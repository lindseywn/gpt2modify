{"Charles J. Baker": "Charles Joseph Baker (May 28, 1821 \u2013 September 23, 1894) was an American politician, businessman and banker. He was Mayor of Baltimore temporarily during the American Civil War for 88 days, from October 1861 to January 1862. He was also known for running his family's glass, paints and oils business, \"Baker Bros. &amp; Co.\" and serving as the president of Franklin Bank. \n\n## Early life\n\n Charles Joseph Baker was born on May 28, 1821, at his father's estate \"Friendsbury\" in Baltimore. He was educated at schools in Baltimore. He graduated from Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania in 1841. While in college, Baker joined the Methodist Episcopal Church. \n\n## Career\n\n Baker worked with his father in the manufacturing of window glass, paints and oils on South Charles Street in Baltimore. In 1865, Baker fully owned the business, \"Baker Bros. &amp; Co.\", and brought in his two sons, William and Charles E. Baker, to help. With the help of his brother, Henry J. Baker, they expanded the business to New York City. By 1859, Baker was elected as director of the Franklin Bank on South Street and became president of the bank in 1867. He served in that role for more than twenty years. He retired from the banking business when the Franklin Bank merged into the Equitable National Bank. Baker became a leader in the municipal reform movement in 1859 and 1860. Baker was elected to the second branch of the Baltimore City Council from the thirtieth ward on October 10, 1860. He also served as president of the second branch, which was the lower house in the two body city council. After the expiration of John C. Blackburn's term as president of the first branch of the Baltimore City Council, Baker became ex officio Mayor of Baltimore, due to him being the next line in succession. He continued the term of Mayor George William Brown, who had been arrested on September 12, 1861. Baker's term as mayor would conclude in January 1862 when John Lee Chapman became president of the first branch and ex officio mayor. In total, Baker served as mayor for 88 days. Baker was not recognized as an acting mayor until 1989 when an archivist realized that three temporary mayors followed the arrest of Mayor Brown. Baker continued his term in the second branch through 1862. During the American Civil War, Baker disapproved of the separation of the methodist church into the north and south churches. He established and built Chatsworth Church, an Independent Methodist Church, in Baltimore. He also built other Independent Methodist churches and chapels in Baltimore, including Bethany Church, Epworth Church, Friendsbury chapel and St. John's Chapel. Baker also owned a controlling interest in the \"Baltimore Gazette\" for a time, but ended up selling his interest. Baker also worked as director of the Canton Company in 1870, which developed much of the port of East Baltimore. He is credited for helping to bring the Union Railroad to Canton. \n\n## Personal life\n\n Baker married Elizabeth Bosserman of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on January 4, 1842. They had seven children, including Bernard N. Baker, who became president of the Baltimore Storage and Lighterage Company. His other children were William, Charles E., Mary H., Richard J., Frank M. and Ashby Lee. He had a second wife, Katie. Baker lived at \"Athol\", a country mansion on Frederick Road in Baltimore.

Remains of ancient ashlars on the eastern wall of the castle testify that it was built on the site of the lower town of ancient Ambracia, which had been abandoned since the foundation of nearby Nicopolis in 31 BC. It is unclear when exactly the site of Arta was reoccupied; it is first documented during a Norman siege in 1082, by which time it apparently had some fortifications. The castle was the citadel of the city, and is attributed to the early 13th-century rulers of the Despotate of Epirus of which Arta was the capital, but its current form dates mostly from Ottoman times. The castle was most likely built under Michael II Komnenos Doukas (), the third ruler of Epirus: a monogram attributed to him has been found in a tower close to the main gate. As the capital of the Epirote principality, Arta was often besieged by the Byzantine Empire on the one hand and the Angevins of the Kingdom of Naples on the other. The Byzantines took the city in 1338/39, but it soon fell to the Serbian Empire, before Nikephoros II Orsini restored the Epirote state in 1356/57. The Serbian ruler Simeon Urosh ruled the city after 1359, until it fell to the Albanian Peter Losha, who established the Despotate of Arta. The city remained in Albanian hands until 1416 when, after a long siege, it the city fell to Carlo I Tocco, who thus re-established the Epirote state under his rule. In 1449, Arta was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, who ruled it until 1717, with the exception of a Venetian occupation during the Morean War (1684\u20131699). From 1717 it was a mainland dependency of the Venetian Ionian Islands, until the Fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, when it came under French control, only to be conquered by Ali Pasha of Janina two years later. It then remained part of the Ottoman Empire until the annexation of Arta into the Kingdom of Greece in 1881. \n\n## Description\n\n Built on a low hill, and originally abutting the bed of the Arachthos (it now flows some to the east), the castle walls form an irregular shape extending some long at the northeastern-southwestern axis and up to wide. On the eastern side, once protected by the river, there is a single wall that incorporates part of the ancient city wall of Ambracia. On the other sides, the castle is protected by two walls, an inner one, some high and protected by towers, and an external one of some height, just far enough to enclose the inner wall's towers into its circuit. The inner wall survives intact to the present day, but the outer wall only in isolated stretches. The walls are on average thick. The walls have been reinforced with many bastions, and the towers and parapets modified to hold artillery embrasures by the Ottomans and Venetians.  Remains of a Byzantine-era church and building suggest that these may have been the palace and palace church of the Despots of Epirus. Almost all archaeological remains in the interior of the castle have been wiped out, however, by the construction of a Xenia hotel in the 1960s.", "Carex madrensis": "Carex madrensis is a tussock-forming species of perennial sedge in the family Cyperaceae.

It is the first true history of Portugal. Earlier historiography produced in Portugal is more general and lacks a distinctly Portuguese focus, but in the \"Chronicle of 1419\" \"for the first time, the kingdom [of Portugal] is the field of observation.\" The work is strictly anonymous. It has sometimes been attributed to Fern\u00e3o Lopes, but this is contested. It is based on earlier written sources, now lost. It has a late and defective manuscript tradition.

The different names come from the fact that the manuscript Porto 886 is incomplete, breaking off in the reign of Afonso III. The common name of the chronicle comes from the date of the start of composition, 1 July 1457 of the Hispanic era, corresponding to AD 1419, as revealed in an early passage.

In the forty hymns of this work, the author expresses his devotion and love to the preserver deity, Vishnu, and also lists twenty-seven sites he would like to visit to venerate the deity. \n\n## Hymns\n\n \n\n## Theme\n\n Along with its companion poem called the \"Periya Tirumatal\", the \"Ciriya Tirumatal\" employs a poetic device from Sangam literature called the ma\u1e6dal. This referred to an ancient Tamil custom through which a lovesick man attempted to win the heart of his beloved by refusing food and drink, bathing, sleep, and other daily activities, and wandered the streets while singing about the woman he loved. In a last resort, the man expressed his willingness to take his own life in the presence of his beloved. The custom was romanticised, and hence traditionally ended with the woman being moved by the devotion of the man, agreeing to marry him. In this work, Tirumangai Alvar assumes the role of a gopika, a milk-maid lover of Krishna, and performs a ma\u1e6dal to win the deity's heart. By doing so, he breaks the convention of women not being allowed to perform the custom, citing his adherence to the northern Sanskrit school of Sri Vaishnavism as opposed to the southern Tamil school.

They are most common in developing countries and areas of conflict, where the children's parents have been killed by conflict or disease. In some cases, relatives of the children adopt them after the parents die. Situations where a child, usually the eldest, has to provide for the family happen when there are no adult relatives to take the children or the relatives can not afford to support more children. Whether and how much the government helps the orphaned family depends on the country. Most help comes from charity and aid organisations like UNICEF. Child-headed families are most common in Africa. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has led to many situations where both parents have died and left behind a family of orphans. The children may begin taking over their parent's responsibilities before the last surviving parent has died, when the parent is sick or too weak to work. The eldest children often have to stop going to school and get a job instead in order to gain income for the family. A study by Cornell University in 2005 showed that, in Namibia, the average age of the children acting as parents in their families was 17; some were as young as 9 years old. The number of children heading households in sub-Saharan Africa is reported to be growing. A survey in South Africa in 2006 showed that 122,000 (0.67%) of the country's children were living in child-headed households.

Taking advantage of the instability, Chakh launched a mighty uprising against the Mongol Empire. \n\n## The uprising\n\n Mengu Khan gathered an army, however, fearing it is not large enough, he also asked help from Russian princes. Aim of the campaign was the capture and destruction of the city Dedyakov, the center of the uprising. The \"Glorious city Yassky Dedyakov\" was besieged in the beginning of 1278, until it fell to the troops of Mengu-Timur in February of the same year, after which it was plundered and then burned down.

After another year as director of programming at the computer center of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (again working on programming language design) he returned in 1966 to the Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional as a professor in the School of Physics and Mathematics and coordinator for applied mathematics. Here, as well as the development of programming languages and software for scientific visualization, his interests returned to physics, including issues of degeneracy in the solution of physical equations, and quantum two-body problems involving a magnetic monopole (the so-called MICZ Kepler system, in which the M stands for McIntosh). After nine years at the Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, McIntosh moved in 1975 to the Institute of Sciences of the Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla, where he became the founding director of the Department of Microcomputer Applications. There, his interests shifted to cellular automata for the final decades of his career. He died in Puebla, Mexico on November 30, 2015. \n\n## Recognition\n\n McIntosh was a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences.

", "G\u00fctel": "The G\u00fctel (sg., pl.) is a variant of and synonym for the \"Kobold\" in German folklore. Originating in the Middle High German term \"g\u00fctel\" \"g\u00fcttel\" (= little god) signifying an idol, the name was later connected with the adjective \"gut\" = good. The \"G\u00fctel\" is first attested in 1507 as \"G\u00fcttgen\", denoting a hunchbacked \"Kobold\". Georgius Agricola mentions them as Saxon mining sprites in the Latinized form \"gutelos\" (acc. pl. masc.) based on which they entered Swiss literature as \"Guteli\" or \"Gueteli\". Other early sources from the 16th or 17th century call them \"G\u00fctelen\" or \"G\u00fcttichen\". Dialectal variants of the name \"G\u00fctel\" are \"G\u00fctchen\", \"G\u00fctgen\", \"G\u00fcdgen\", \"G\u00fcetel\", \"Gietel\", \"Gitel\", \"Gidl\", \"Gidle\", \"G\u00f6thel\", and \"J\u00fctel\" (sg., pl.; alternate pl. \"J\u00fcteln\"). Further corruption of its name and confusion with the word \"Jude\" = Jew made the \"G\u00fctel\" a \"J\u00fcdel\", \"J\u00fcdelchen\", \"J\u00fcdchen\", \"J\u00fcdgen\" (all diminutives of Jew), \"J\u00fclchen\" or, through further derivation, \"Hebr\u00e4erchen\" (diminutive of \"Hebr\u00e4er\" = Hebrew) in Thuringia, Saxony, and Lower Lusatia. Another name from the Vogtland and the Ore Mountains is \"Heug\u00fctel\" (hay \"G\u00fctel\"), in dialect variously given as \"Heigidl\", \"Heigidle\", \"Heigitel\", \"Hagitel\", and \"Haagitel\". \n\n## Identity, appearance and dwelling\n\n The \"G\u00fctel\" appear in the Vogtland and the Ore Mountains as domestic sprites or the souls or deceased children. The same is true for the \"Heug\u00fctel\" of the same regions which, despite appearing as a bearded old manikin inhabiting the hayloft (hence the name), really is the soul of a child who died unbaptized, though it can also appear colored black. For this reason newborn children have to be baptized soon so that they don't become \"Heug\u00fctel\". Thus it is not surprising when the footprints left behind in ash by the \"Heug\u00fctel\" are like that of little children. The \"G\u00fctel\" or \"G\u00fctchen\" also dwells inside the stove. In Lower Lusatia, the \"G\u00fctel\" are \"Erdm\u00e4nnlein\" (sg., pl.; earth manikins), i.e. dwarves. The same is said about the \"J\u00fcdel\". In Halle (Saale) in Saxony-Anhalt, the newborn children are said to come from the \"G\u00fctchenteich\" (\"G\u00fctel\" pond) or the \"G\u00fctchengrube\" (\"G\u00fctel\" pit). The former relates the G.s to water sprites, as does the \"G\u00fctgesbach\" (\"G\u00fctel\" creek) near Bonn in North Rhine-Westphalia. In Lusatia, the \"J\u00fcdelchen\" are also behind the appearances of the will-o'-the-wisps (German \"Irrlichter\"). \n\n## Activities\n\n The \"G\u00fctel\" usually is a good-natured, obliging, and child-friendly household spirit, while the rather malicious \"J\u00fctel\" or \"J\u00fcdel\" tends to torment domestic animals and children. The characteristics blend into each other, though. The connection between the \"G\u00fctel\" and Jews is purely dialectal in its origin and by no means is the\" J\u00fcdel\" any worse than many other legendary creatures, although a certain underlying historical anti-Semitic sentiment can clearly be seen. The \"Heug\u00fctel\" is a swift little helper in house and stable. It particularly likes to cradle the children to sleep and dallies with the child in its sleep. The \"J\u00fcdel\", \"J\u00fctel\" or \"G\u00fctgen\" teases the little children in their sleep making them restless, and it also causes them various diseases such as chills and ague, seizures, and measles. Seizures in particular are caused by the \"Gietel\" playing with the child. Women in childbirth are also in jeopardy. Often it is already enough to distract the spirit with various amusements such as some bathing water left over placed on the stove inside a little pot for the \"G\u00fctel\" to dabble with. Eggshells and playing cards hung on the crib or bow and arrows placed in the cellar and barn are also for the \"G\u00fctel\" to play with. It can be kept away, though, by greasing the stove door with a bacon rind or by lacing a straw from the bed of the woman in childbirth at every door. In Saxony, the \"J\u00fcdel\" is driven away by a gift of new clothes. A gift of clothing also drives the usually half-naked benign \"Heug\u00fctel\" away, and with it also the blessing on the house. Furthermore, the \"Heug\u00fctel\" only stays in houses where the inhabitants are pious and live a Christian life. If somebody has already fallen ill, or if at night a loud, heavy plunge was heard which, according to belief in the Ore Mountains, is an omen of impending death, then the \"G\u00fctgen\" is offered animals as sacrifice which it kills instead. The offerings are as follows: a cock for a man, a sow for a woman, a goat for the person actually offering the animal, or hens for children. At night, the \"J\u00fctel\" or \"J\u00fcdel\" enters the stable and plays with the cows until they growl and harasses the horses until they wildly bite and kick around. \"J\u00fcdel\" and \"G\u00fcttichen\" also like to tangle the manes of horses and hair of women. The resulting Polish plait is thus called \"J\u00fcdenzopf\" (Jew plait) or \"G\u00fcttichen Zopf\" (\"G\u00fctel\" plait). From this activity of knotting hair together, in Upper Saxony the \"G\u00fctel\" is also known as \"Haarg\u00fctel\" in Standard German and \"Hoorgitel\" in dialect. Both terms mean \"hair \"G\u00fctel\". In Saxony, a \"J\u00fctel\", \"J\u00fcdchen\" or \"M\u00fctzchen\" (little cap (wearer)) is attested once to practice \"aufhocken\"\" (leaping upon a person's back and forcing them to carry the \"aufhock\"ing spirit), tormenting lonesome travelers until they are faint, out of breath, and ill due to that experience. This \"Hockelm\u00e4nnchen\" (\"aufhock\"ing manikin) appears in the woods.", "Greg Lakin": "Greg Lakin is an American politician who served in the Kansas House of Representatives as a Republican for one year, from January of 2017 to January 8, 2018.

He is best known as a freedom fighter against the British East India Company, and for the construction of the Miah Bari Mosque, which continues to be a popular tourist attraction in southern Bangladesh. \n\n## Biography\n\n Hayat Mahmud was born in the 18th century, and was most probably the son of Maldar Khan, who was employed in the military of the feudal Raja of Chandradwip. Mahmud was also admitted to the Chandradwip military forces. On one occasion, the Raja was kidnapped by two rival feudal families of nearby Chakhar, the Mirs and Majumdars. Mahmud then rose to popularity after embarking on a night mission to free the Raja. To express gratitude for this service, the Raja granted two taluqs to Maldar Khan and Hayat Mahmud, which were later inherited by Mahmud's descendants who are known as the Mia family of Karapur. The pargana of Buzurg-Umedpur was also one of Hayat Mahmud's \"taluqs\". Having now become a powerful feudal lord in South Bengal, the British East India Company later posed a threat to his status. Mahmud refused to comply with the Company rule in Bengal and surrender the Buzurg-Umpedpur pargana. As a result, the British officers were instructed to close off all water routes to Barisal. Mahmud was declared as a \"Dacoit Sardar\" (bandit chieftain). The Company sepoys managed to capture him in 1789 and took him to their ally Nusrat Jung, the erstwhile Naib Nazim of Jahangir Nagar, who was considered to have been an anglophile. In 1790, the Naib Nazim suggested that Mahmud receives lifetime imprisonment. Lord Cornwallis then had Mahmud exiled to the Prince of Wales Island in British Malaya and stripped his zamindari of Buzurg-Umedpur. Mahmud was released in 1806 and thereafter avoided getting into any disputes with the Company rule and began living a quieter life. He built a new home on 30 acres of land in Karapur.

He published his first viral videos in 2006, being considered the first youtuber in Brazil, and a pioneer of the so-called \"vlogger era\". His video \"Confiss\u00f5es de um emo\", recorded in 2006, in February 2015 was still the most viewed Brazilian video on Youtube, with more than six million views, being elected by the news website \"Ga\u00fachaZH\" as one of the 10 most famous memes in Brazil. \n\n## Career\n\n In 2006, when the first vlogs became popular in the United States, YouTube, launched just a year earlier, with about 50 million users, two million of which were in Brazil. At that time, an 18-year-old young man from Brasilia, Guilherme Zaiden, motivated by the lack of creativity in Brazilian humor, essentially because of a heteronormative culture, with homophobic and sexist tendencies, began making home videos, with a hand held camera and talking to himself for hours on end. He created characters that would make him famous, such as: an Orkut addict, a prejudiced pastor and an emo. The first video, \"Confiss\u00f5es de um emo\", was posted on July 21, 2006. In the video, Zaiden staged as the character \"Bonequinho de Porcelana\", a boy dissatisfied with being labeled as an emo. In 2015, celebrating twenty years of Internet in Brazil, the news website Ga\u00fachaZH chose the video \"Confiss\u00f5es de um emo\", by Guilherme Zaiden, as one of the 10 most famous memes in Brazil. On February 13 of the same year, \"Confiss\u00f5es de um emo\" continued to be the Brazilian video with most views, being one of only two with more than six million hits. As of 2017, the video had 7 million views. Guilherme Zaiden was also, together with Clarah Averbuckee, one of the creators of the term blocks, derived from the English words blog and book, obtaining in 2006, on average, 50 million views in the shared productions, resulting in books based on the reports registered in the videos posted and acclaimed on blog pages. Despite the success of millions of views on the videos he produced, Zaiden's insecurity made him not take advantage of the success, and abandoned the platform about a year later, not even taking advantage of Google's partnership program, which was launched in 2007, where the company gives a portion of advertising revenue to those who produce videos. Despite this hiatus, in 2008 and 2009 Zaiden was still referred to as a champion of views and was considered an Internet celebrity, which led to Globo's invitation to participate in the soap opera Caminho das \u00cdndias in January 2009. In 2015, Zaiden returned to YouTuber activity, taking a break shortly after. Despite posting few videos after 2007, in 2018 the YouTube channel \"Zaiden\" was still considered a reference in Internet humor.

(Edinburgh)": "Hanover Football Club was a football club from the city of Edinburgh.  \n\n## History\n\n The club was formed in 1875, and was a founder member of the Edinburgh Football Association later in the year. The first fixture recorded for the club was a 1\u20131 draw with 3rd Edinburgh Rifle Volunteers F.C. on the Meadows in September 1875. Hanover was one of the four sides which took part in the first Edinburgh FA Cup, losing to the 3rd E.R.V. in its one tie. Hanover's first entry to the Scottish Cup was in 1876\u201377, losing to Edinburgh Thistle. The club improved its playing strength for 1877\u201378, retaining the previous season's players and developing a large membership, making it \"one of the most promising of the district clubs\", and although not as physically strong as the other side, considered a speedy side. The club's work was rewarded with a win in the first round of the Scottish Cup, 1\u20130 against the Thistle, and only going out to the strong Hibernian F.C. in a replay.  However that Cup win would be the club's only win in the Scottish Cup, despite entering every year until 1881\u201382. The club had more success in the Edinburgh Cup, regularly reaching the fourth round, although it had only one more semi-final appearance (in 1878\u201379).  The club did reach one final; in the 1878\u201379 President's Cup, a one-off tournament for a trophy presented by the President of the Edinburgh FA. Hanover brought in four players from Govan F.C. in order to gain an advantage in the final, which led to a protest from opponents Heart of Midlothian F.C., and the game only went ahead after the regulations were checked and there found to be no rule against it. The match, at the Powderhall Stadium, ended 4\u20134, and Hearts scored the winner in extra-time. By 1882 the club had fallen behind the two big Edinburgh clubs, and for a friendly with Hearts could only muster 10 players, and even that was only achieved by borrowing two from the short-lived Elgin club of Stockbridge Park.

He was the eldest of the four sons of Be\u1e93alel ben \u1e24ayim, and spent his youth at Posen, the native city of the family (compare \"\"Monatsschrift f\u00fcr die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums\",\" xiii. 371). He and Moses Isserles studied with Shalom Shachna, whose methods of teaching he adopted largely. He began his literary activity at Worms, where he had gone in 1549; and, apparently, he succeeded his uncle Jakob ben Chajim as rabbi in that city, after Jakob's death in 1563 (compare his introduction to \"\"Mayim \u1e24ayim\" (), printed in \"Ha-Shiloa\u1e25\",\" \u00a7 9). He subsequently went as rabbi to Friedberg; in 1578 this district was ravaged by a terrible plague, which caused the death of one of \u1e24ayim's servants. In consequence of this occurrence \u1e24ayim and his family were quarantined in his house for two months. During this time he wrote his ethical work \"\"Sefer ha-\u1e24ayim\" (Hebrew: ), consisting of five books. \u1e24ayim carried on a heated controversy with his former schoolfellow Moses Isserles, also indirectly aiming at Joseph Karo. He did not approve of their attempts to collect the laws found in the Talmud and other authoritative works in a book suitable for the general public. The reasons for his objections he set forth in the introduction to his \"Mayim \u1e24ayim\" (Hebrew: ), which includes a criticism of Moses Isserles' \"Torat ha-\u1e24a\u1e6d\u1e6dot\" (Hebrew: ). \u1e24ayim held that through such codices the study of the Talmud would be neglected and the standing of the rabbis injured, since every layman could turn to these books for the solution of difficult questions. Moreover, the writer of such codes would gain too much authority over other teachers, whereas every rabbi ought to arrive at his decisions independently. Such codes, moreover, could not take into account the \"minhagim\" of all countries; and this, again, would lead to constraint in matters of conscience, since every one would have to observe the \"minhagim\" obtaining in the place where the author of the code in question was living. \u1e24ayim died at Friedberg on the Shavuot festival, 1588. \n\n## Works\n\n \u1e24ayim's works include:", "Guy Eden": "Guy Ernest Morton Eden (6 May 1864 \u2013 5 December 1954) was a lawyer, novelist, poet and librettist. Born in Australia, Eden was educated in England, practised law in New South Wales and then London, and was a legal adviser to two British government departments. As a writer, between 1892 and 1931 he produced two novels, a volume of poetry, the book and lyrics for operas and musical comedies, and was co-author of two plays. Among his works was \"The Mountaineers\" (1909), one of the last Savoy operas. \n\n## Life and career\n\n \n\n## Early years\n\n Eden was born on 6 May 1864 in Brisbane, the elder son of English parents temporarily based in Australia, Charles Henry Eden and his wife Georgina, \"n\u00e9e\" Hill. He was educated at Westminster School, after which he returned to Australia and practised as a barrister in New South Wales. In 1897 he married Ethel, daughter of William Holman. They had three sons and one daughter. 1901 he was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in London.  Eden twice (1903\u20131905 and 1907\u20131913) served as lawyer to the Board of Education, and from 1914 to 1918 he was attached to the directorate of military intelligence at the War Office. In 1918 he became editor of \"The Navy\". Eden was the author of two novels. The first, \"The Cry of the Curlew\" (1892), was sub-titled \"A Yarn from the Bush\". The reviewer in \"The Globe\" observed: The second of Eden's novels was \"He Went Out with the Tide\" (1896), a work with some autobiographical elements. \"The Academy\" praised its \"natural pathos\". Eden also published a book of verse with an Australian setting, entitled \"Bush Ballads\" (1907). A contemporary reviewer commented that although the verses were full of technical faults, they \"are the real thing; they have the rough vigour of a young country\". \n\n## Stage works\n\n Eden was responsible for the libretto of the one-act romantic opera \"The 'Prentice Pillar\" (1895), which was produced at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1897. It was not well received; the music, by Reginald Somerville, was found \"pretentious\" and \"commonplace\", and Eden's libretto was termed \"wantonly tragic\", of \"extreme crudeness of construction\", ending with \"terrible issues that are not adequately prepared\". Eden and Somerville collaborated again, on a comic opera, \"The Mountaineers\", produced at the Savoy Theatre in 1909. It received a better reception than their earlier work. \"The Times\" commented that \"it provides a very pleasant, pretty, amusing entertainment. ... A good story, well told; but told without wit, without distinction.\" \"The Manchester Guardian\" found both the story and music \"simple and charming\" but felt that the subject was not \"strong enough to occupy a whole evening\". Eden wrote the book and lyrics of \"an original musical comedy extravaganza\", \"Goldman, Ltd\" (1916) with music by Arthur Aiston. In 1925 Eden again worked with Somerville, providing the lyrics and co-writing the book of the show \"The Love Doctor\", presented by and starring Arthur Treacher. Eden was co-author of two non-musical plays: a comedy, \"When the Clock Strikes\" (1930) and a Ruritanian adventure, \"The Gun Runner\" (1931). \"The Stage\" records that he also wrote the words for many popular songs.

The range of Portunus armatus overlaps with Portunus pelagicus in the Northern Territory of Australia. Portunus armatus is a commercially and recreationally important fishing crab. Although it is resilient to overfishing, collapse of populations have occurred in some areas where there has been adverse environmental conditions and heavy fishing. These crabs inhabit waters from 50 m depth through to the intertidal zone, moving from shallower to deeper water in winter. Individuals in estuaries will move to the ocean in response to fresh water from winter rains. They prefer areas with flat muddy or sandy bottoms with seagrass or algae. They reach maturity in one year, and live to an age of 2-3 years. Maximum size across the carapace is around 200mm to 250mm, with up to 800mm maximum claw span.  The color is variable, but the carapace of males is generally dark blue-green with spots overall and bands at the front, whereas females are similarly pattered but brownish and with the tips of the claws deep brownish red.

Social philosophers Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser point to a 21st-century shift in theories of justice away from distributive justice (which emphasises the elimination of economic inequalities) toward recognition justice and the eliminating of humiliation and disrespect. The shift toward recognition justice is associated with the rise of identity politics. The political implications of recognition justice are more ambiguous than distributive justice, because recognition is not a resource than can be redistributed, but is rather a phenomenological experience of people and groups. \n\n## Background and debate\n\n Nancy Fraser critiques over-reliance on recognition justice, arguing for a combination of distributive and recognition justice to guarantee equal participation in society. Fraser states that since 1989, the political left has entered a post-socialist period marked by the absence of any credible vision for a just society. In this absence, claims by subaltern groups for recognition of difference have become \u201cintensely salient\u2026 at times eclipsing claims for social equality.\u201d She further observes that 21st century social movements are increasingly defined as cultural groups rather than as economic classes (as was the case prior to the 1990s when a socialist/Marxist analysis dominated leftist ideology). Fraser aims to integrate claims for recognition with claims for redistribution in the context of rising neoliberalism that has resulted in further concentration of wealth and distributive injustice. David Ingram in his book \"World Crisis and Underdevelopment\" claims that injustice always implies lack of recognition. He promotes recognition justice, stating that \u201crecognition theory takes up everyday feelings of moral outrage, encourages theoretical elaboration of new concepts by which to name and identify the harms that occasion that outrage, and thereby provides theoretical guidance to the formation of social movements aimed at overcoming a vast array of distinctive types of social injustices.\u201d Schweiger critiques Ingram's claims that injustice implies lack of recognition, stating that certain forms of epistemic injustice have \u201cprecisely the form of separating injustices and experiences of misrecognition.\u201d He asserts that phenomenologically, most people do not understand the injustices they face and may unquestioningly accept their own exploitation. \n\n## Environmental justice\n\n Environmental justice scholar Kyle Powys Whyte promotes recognition justice as a framework for evaluating the fairness of interactions between American Indigenous people and the US federal government. He elaborates that distributive, procedural, and corrective justice frameworks can't be applied to tribal contexts without recognising native peoples' unique experiences with colonisation and political statuses. Tribal environmental struggles can't be reduced to class conflicts, and Indigenous peoples' economic aspirations may not be commensurable with the economic values of the dominant society. Colville scholar Dina Gilio-Whitaker also states that environmental justice frameworks should recognise Indigenous peoples' special legal relationship with the federal government and spiritual interdependence with the Earth.", "Qinghe Bridge": "The Qinghe Bridge () is a historic stone arch bridge over the Xianqiao River () in the town of , Deqing County, Zhejiang, China. \n\n## History\n\n Qinghe Bridge was originally built by magistrate Chen Zhifang () between 1064 and 1067 during the Northern Song dynasty (960\u20131279), but because of war and natural disasters has been rebuilt numerous times since then.

Most of the songs on the album were not completely written prior to entering the studio, which is uncharacteristic for the band. The album was written during the COVID-19 pandemic and recorded in nine days at the Seattle studio Crackle &amp; Pop before bassist Guy Maddison moved to Australia. The album was promoted by the single \"Almost Everything\" and a world tour. Singles \"Move Under\" and \"Little Dogs\" followed. April 7, 2023 was proclaimed Mudhoney Day by King County, Washington to coincide with the album release. \n\n## Reception\n\n \"Plastic Eternity\" received positive reviews from critics noted at review aggregator Metacritic. It has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on six reviews. \"Glide Magazine\" notes unexpected moments in the music, such as the inclusion of love ballad \"Little Dogs\" and the publication sums up the review that the recording is \"a fun alternative album that channels political fury into a fiery collection of aggressive rock\". For \"Louder Sound\", Everett True gave this album 3.5 out of five stars, opining that \"Mudhoney remain their own, inherent force of nature\".

It comprises cataphract arrays of box-like chambers, forming a club-shaped thallus surrounding a hollow central cavity. It was first described from phosphatized microfossils whose individual chambers were interpreted as housing the zooids of a non-mineralized bryozoan, which would make it the only affinity representative of that phylum \u2013 implying that all animal phyla originated in the Cambrian period. The subsequent discovery of articulated macrofossils from the Xiaoshiba biota called into question the biological nature of the distal apertures, showing that the surface was instead covered with leaf-like triangular flanges. This has led to the reinterpretation of the fossil material as a \"seaweed\", strictly as a dasycladalean green alga. \n\n## History of description\n\n \"Protomelission\" was first described by Brock &amp; Cooper in 1993 from limestones in Wirrealpa, Australia. A bryozoan affinity was dismissed on the basis that its walls were too thin, among other things. The fossil material was complemented by additional specimens from China, causing Brock and colleagues to revisit this earlier statement. A key line of evidence in favour of the bryozoan affinity was the regular array of openings exhibited by each chamber. However, these openings were later argued to have arisen taphonomically, i.e. by abrasion of an originally solid wall, or by enlarging a much smaller original hole. Where a bryozoan affinity would denote the presence of a stalked ring of tentacles emerging from each module, the recovery of macrofossil material with soft tissue preservation demonstrated that each chamber was instead associated with a tapering conical flange, better suited to photosynthesis. Authors of the original study are unconvinced by this reinterpretation, suggesting in media reports that the absence of tentacles may in turn be an effect of imperfect preservation. \n\n## Available fossil material\n\n \"Protomelission\" is known from two distinct modes of preservation: small shelly fossils from Australia and China, which are millimetric phosphatized fragments; and Burgess Shale-type macrofossils, which preserve more delicate anatomy. The former are fully three-dimensional; the latter, squashed into a couple of planes of mudstone. These different preservational modes mean that the material from the two settings is not identical, and it is challenging to establish beyond doubt that the two forms of fossil belong to the same species, or even on a cynical view both to the same sort of organism.  Whether or not the two types of fossil are conspecific, Yang et al. argue that the similarity in gross morphology is sufficient to show that a dasyclad interpretation is plausible for both sets of fossil material, and that the material cannot be considered a \"bona fide\" bryozoan. \n\n## Further reading\n\n https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/2023-03-08/ty-article/.premium/a-hiccup-in-the-annals-of-animal-evolution-that-thing-was-a-plant/00000186-bce3-d247-a5ff-feef7d670000", "President Kun": "President Kun may refer to:", "Portrait of Count Antonio Porcia and Brugnera": "Portrait of Count Antonio Porcia and Brugnera (Italian: \"Ritratto del conte Antonio di Porcia e Brugnera\") is an oil painting by Titian, dated to between 1535 and 1540, which hangs in the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan. \n\n## Description\n\n A half-length figure in black, the face turned forwards, an energetic head in repose; across the breast is a broad gold chain with an ornament hanging from it; in the somewhat sombre lower portion of the picture there is the shining knob of the sword and the spot of white in the cuff.

The album was given positive reviews at the time of its release.  \n\n## Background and content\n\n Both Porter Wagoner and Skeeter Davis both had successful solo careers in the country genre. Both were also signed to the RCA Victor label. Wagoner first gained an RCA contract in the mid 1950s and had first top ten single with 1955's \"A Satisfied Mind\". Wagoner continued having charting singles, but did not become more successful until the early sixties when his own television show became successful. Skeeter Davis was formerly one half of the duo, The Davis Sisters. After a car accident that killed the duo's second member, Davis began a successful solo career with RCA. In the late 1950s and early sixties, she reached the country top ten with songs like \"Set Him Free\" and \"My Last Date (With You)\". Wagoner and Davis first collaborated together for the album's recording. It was produced by Chet Atkins, who both recorded the artists in their individual careers at RCA. The sessions for the album took place in February 1962 at RCA Victor Studios, located in Nashville, Tennessee. The entire project was a collection of duets between the pair. Most of its tracks were covers of previously-recorded country songs. Among them was The Davis Sisters's original \"Rock-A-Bye Boogie\". Among the album's other cover tunes were \"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You\", \"Gonna Find Me a Bluebird\" and \"A Little Bitty Tear\". \n\n## Release and reception\n\n \"Porter Wagoner and Skeeter Davis Sing Duets\" was originally released in May 1962 on the RCA Victor label. It was originally distributed as a vinyl LP, containing six recordings on either side of the record. Upon its release, the album was given critical attention by \"Billboard\" magazine. In June 1962, the publication named it among its \"Spotlight Albums of the Week\". Critics noted the album's mix of traditional country along with a defined \"string section\". The further added, \"Their singing is first-rate and sure to score with country buyers.\" The publication also highlighted the album track \"Above and Beyond\" on a separate page of the same issue.  One single was issued in the original release: \"Rock-A-Bye Boogie\". The single was issued through RCA Victor in Germany. In 2013, the album was re-released in a digital format via Rockabilly Records. The re-release consisted of a different track listing than the original LP version.

After the baker had finished making his bread, the potato dish would cook slowly while the oven gradually died down. \n\n## Ingredients and variations\n\n The basic ingredients are potatoes, onions and cooking liquid. The dish, cooked slowly in a low oven, gradually absorbing the cooking liquid, has a crisp top layer of sliced potatoes, with a softer mixture of onion and potato beneath. It is usual to season it with some or all of garlic, herbs (particularly rosemary or sage), salt and pepper, and to top the dish with dabs of butter before cooking, but there are several published variations: Despite the French name, the dish is not unique to France. The Yorkshire-born chef Brian Turner recalled in his memoirs (2000) being given an identical potato dish in his childhood, and Bobby Freeman in a 1997 book about Welsh cuisine gives a recipe for traditional \"Teisen nionod\" (onion cake), which she describes as \"the same dish as the French \"pommes boulang\u00e8re\"\".

The type specimen was collected by Danish botanist Frederik Liebmann between Cerro Le\u00f3n and La Hoya, Mexico. Mason Hale and William Louis Culberson transferred the taxon to the genus \"Pseudevernia\" in a 1966 publication. \n\n## Description\n\n \"Pseudevernia consocians\" has a thallus form that can range from leafy (foliose) to somewhat bushy (fruticose). It usually measures between in diameter, and it has a smooth texture with a grayish hue. The lobes that compose the thallus are linear and dichotomously branched, overlapping each other with truncated tips, and they are typically 0.3\u20131.5\u00a0mm wide (some are up to 3\u00a0mm wide). Cylindrical isidia are abundant on the thallus surface, presenting tips that are darker than the rest of the thallus. The medulla is loosely packed and has a white coloration. The lower thallus surface is attached through basal holdfasts (without rhizines), with a color ranging from tan to black, sometimes with occasional white mottling. The pycnidia are positioned in either a or arrangement, and they can present as immersed, emergent, or sessile. Other superficially similar species are \"Pseudevernia cladonia\" and \"Evernastrum catawbiense\". The former can be distinguished from \"Pseudevernia consocians\" by the lack of isidia, while the latter produces soralia rather than isidia. The expected results for standard chemical spot tests are as follows: upper K+ (yellow), and medulla K\u2212, C+ (red), KC+ (red), and P\u2212. The cortex contains atranorin and chloroatranorin as major and minor lichen products, respectively, while the medulla contains lecanoric acid as the major substance.

It is dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos. The church is located on the site of an earlier wooden church, called \"Popa Iva\u0219cu\u2019s\". The present structure was built of masonry in 1795 by Prince Alexander Mourouzis; it was decorated with frescoes on bare mortar. It was mentioned by \"ban\" Mihai Cantacuzino on an 1828 plan, and in registers of 1810 and 1831. Its current name, first appearing in 1818, is believed to have initially referred to the surrounding district, where an old man (\"mo\u0219\"), a Bulgarian gardener named Pedar, cultivated vegetables; he lived over a century and died before 1805. According to the old \"pisanie\", repairs took place in 1898. Consolidation, financed by parishioners, was undertaken after the 1940 earthquake. More repairs happened in 1964, and it was re-sanctified by Patriarch Justinian Marina in 1966, when the painting was redone. In 2003, the facade was repaired and painted in white, and a new, carved entrance door was installed. The cross-shaped church measures 24 meters long by 9.5-10.7 meters wide, with slightly deep side apses, polygonal on the exterior. The two square-based domes are nearly equal in size and have bulb-shaped roofs. The slightly projected cornice runs along the arches of the side facades of both the octagonal bell tower and the twelve-sided Pantocrator dome. The enclosed portico with ornamental stained-glass windows, has a wide middle arch. The narthex is covered by a rounded ceiling between two wide arches.

After the census, the rural district was elevated to the status of a district and divided into two rural districts and no cities.", "Premarital medical examination": "Beginning in the early 20th century, a number of states have passed laws mandating medical examinations for one or both parties before marriage. The most common requirement was a blood test for syphilis, though other diseases such as gonorrhea and rubella were sometimes also targeted. If a partner tested positive, they would generally be required to undergo treatment before they could receive a marriage license. Such laws were once widespread in the United States, with all but eight states requiring premarital blood tests by 1954. Mandatory testing was also in effect in parts of Canada, and some European nations such as Sweden. Most of these laws were repealed by the late 20th or early 21st century. \n\n## Tests\n\n \n\n## Syphilis\n\n Syphilis was the disease most commonly targeted by premarital examination laws. Syphilis was relatively widespread in the first half of the twentieth century, estimated to affect more than 10% of Americans during their lifetime, with many of those afflicted unaware that they were carrying the disease. Because syphilis could be transmitted from mother to child, and cause birth defects, detecting the presence of the disease prior to marriage (and the subsequent production of offspring) was seen as a beneficial public health measure. The most common blood test for syphilis was the Wassermann test, developed in 1906 by August von Wassermann, though results of the alternative Kahn test were also usually accepted. If a partner tested positive, they would generally be required to undergo a course of treatment until a doctor was satisfied that the infection was resolved. Before the introduction of penicillin as an effective single-dose treatment in the 1940s, patients were treated with arsenic-based drugs such as Arsphenamine which took a year or more to clear the infection. \n\n## HIV\n\n Beginning in the 1980s, a number of national and subnational governments have implemented or considered implementing mandatory HIV testing prior to marriage. As of 2010, regions with such laws in effect included Bahrain, certain provinces of China, Libya, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Uzbekistan. In the United States, more than thirty states considered premarital HIV testing laws in the 1980s, with Illinois and Louisiana briefly enacting mandatory testing statutes. Only a small number of statutes under consideration would have barred the issuance of a marriage license in the case of a positive test. In some areas, premarital HIV tests are mandated by local churches, such as the Church of Uganda, the Baptist Community of Congo, the Catholic Church of Burundi, and certain churches in Kenya and Nigeria. \n\n## Other conditions\n\n Other conditions which have been the subject of mandatory premarital testing include: \n\n## United States\n\n \n\n## Prior to 1935\n\n As early as 1913, a number of US states had laws in effect concerning marriage and venereal disease, though many targeted only the husband and not the wife. For example, in Alabama, North Dakota, Oregon and Wisconsin, male applicants for a marriage license were required to submit a medical certificate stating that they were free of venereal disease. Other states, including Indiana, Michigan, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Vermont, forbade a person having a venereal disease from marrying, but had no measures in place for enforcing this. In total, 25 states passed some form of early \"eugenic marriage laws\", though only a minority required a blood test. \n\n## 1935\u20131950s\n\n A wave of more effective laws requiring blood tests for both partners were passed by state legislatures between 1935 and 1950, beginning with Connecticut's \"premarital examination law\", which served as a model for other states. The Connecticut law required both parties undergo a blood test for syphilis and a physical examination. The spread of these laws was abetted by Surgeon General Thomas Parran, who, during this period, embarked on a public health campaign to reduce syphilis rates and inform the public about the disease. Premarital blood testing requirements were also supported by the American eugenics movement, which regarded them as one measure to prevent reproduction of the unfit. In 1937, five states passed premarital examination laws similar to that of Connecticut, with a further twelve states doing the same from 1938 to 1939. By 1954, all but eight states and the District of Columbia required premarital blood tests. The laws were very popular with the American public. For example, in a 1944 survey of readers of \"Woman's Home Companion\", 98% of respondents answered yes to the question \"Would you approve a national law which would require premarital blood tests to check venereal disease?\". \n\n## Repeals\n\n American premarital examination laws were gradually repealed between the 1970s and early 2000s. The primary reason cited for these repeals was that testing was no longer cost effective given the low prevalence of syphilis. The first state to repeal its premarital examination law was Maine in 1972. Most had been repealed by the early 2000s, with Mississippi being the last in 2012.", "Rebecka Teper": "\u00c5sa Rebecka Teper (26 July 1972 \u2013 8 April 2023) was a Swedish actress who was known for her roles in television series like \"Solsidan\", \"Morden i Sandhamn\" and \"Bonusfamiljen\".

Matthew of Edessa records that no one living in the city survived the earthquake and that about 40,000 people living in Marash died. That number seems excessive since the population of the town is estimated to have been a few thousand only. Michael the Syrian records that the city of Marash is a tomb for its own people. Al-Azimi records that it was dark before the earthquake, and then it snowed and covered with snow on all sides.

The amendment shrinked the cabinet to having only three elected members, the Attorney General, Chief Financial Officer , and Agriculture Commissioner. The Chief Financial Officer was a new office which came about by combining the offices of Treasurer/Insurance Commissioner/Fire Marshal and Comptroller. The Cabinet also lost its control over the Florida Department of Education: management of K\u201312 education and community college education which was shifted to the new Florida Board of Education and management of the State University System of Florida to the new Florida Board of Governors.

It took place in Newport and consisted of a series of races between the defender \"Ranger\", entered Harold S. Vanderbilt, and \"Endeavour II\", the second in Sir Thomas Sopwith's line of Cup challengers. In 1935, Sir Richard Fairey issued a challenge to the New York Yacht Club for the America's Cup. In it, Fairey proposed that the race be held among K-class yachts, smaller than the J-class raced in the previous two competitions. The NYYC declined this challenge, preferring to keep the competition among the J-class. The following year, Sir Thomas Sopwith, the challenger in the 1934 competition issued a new challenge of his own, for J-class yachts. The NYYC accepted this challenge, but since 1936 was an American presidential election year, they opted to hold the races in 1937. Harold S. Vanderbilt who had been central to the NYYC's previous two defenses, attempted to form a syndicate to fund a defense to Sopwith's challenge. However, the poor state of the American economy meant that he could not attract backers, and eventually funded the entire defense himself, investing $400,000 (around $8.5 million in 2022 dollars). His yacht, \"Ranger\" was designed by Olin Stephens and Stanley Burgess and built at the Bath Iron Works.  Sopwith commissioned \"Endeavour II\" from Charles Nicholson and brought her across the Atlantic with \"Endeavour\" to conduct tests with different combinations of sails and spars.  Because \"Ranger\" was the only candidate put forward to defend the Cup, there were no selection trials, but Vanderbilt practised racing the yacht against the J-class \"Yankee\" which had been an unsuccessful contender for the defense of the cup in 1930.  As in the previous two competitions, the winner was to be the best of seven races. The first three races were uneventful, and \"Ranger\" won them easily \u2014 the second race by over eighteen minutes. In the fourth race, Vanderbilt maneuvered towards the start buoy in a way that forced \"Endeavour II\" to pass the buoy before the starting gun fired. Because of this, \"Endeavour II\" had to circle the buoy and begin the race again, having lost 75 seconds in the maneuver. \"Ranger\" won this race by three minutes and successfully defended the Cup.", "1978 Davidson Wildcats football team": "The 1978 Davidson Wildcats football team represented Davidson College as a member of the Southern Conference during the 1978 NCAA Division I-AA football season.

This was the first industrial action of national significance in Germany during the First World War. It was held to protest the trial of anti-war socialist campaigner Karl Liebknecht. The strike was not supported by the leadership of the German trade unions, who had agreed not to strike during the war as part of the \"Burgfriedenspolitik\", but was organised by a number of junior officials who later became known as the Revolutionary Stewards. The strike was joined by 55,000 Berlin workers from at least 35 factories and several thousand workers from Stuttgart, Bremen, Braunschweig and Essen. Following the strike, wages fell and support for the Stewards declined. Later in the war, the Stewards organised larger strikes, in protest at the continuation of the conflict and cuts in food rations. \n\n## Background\n\n Germany had been fighting the First World War since 1914. Food shortages, caused by the Allied naval blockade, had led to riots in the German capital Berlin in October 1915. Some anti-war sentiment was evident by 1916. Karl Liebknecht, a socialist and anti-war campaigner associated with the Spartacus League, had held a demonstration at Potsdamer Platz in Berlin on 1 May to protest against the war and his conscription into the army as a labourer. The demonstration was broken up by police and Liebknecht imprisoned, awaiting trial. Later in May Socialist youths organised demonstrations in Hanover and Braunschweig against a compulsory war bonds scheme, which led to its abandonment. The socialist youth had diverged from the Social Democratic Party (SPD) over the party's support for the war, and distributed literature denouncing the party. \n\n## Strike\n\n The authorities provided little notice of the trial of Liebknecht, to hinder any planned demonstrations. However the Spartacus League held a demonstration in support of Liebknecht on 27 June, the first day of his trial. At the start of the war the leaders of the German trade unions had agreed not to call any strikes for its duration. However the union members were not united in this regard. Some 50-80 shop stewards associated with the Berlin branch of the German Metal Workers' Union (DMV) favoured a strike in support of Liebknecht. The shop stewards met on the evening of 27 June at the Musiker-Fests\u00e4le dance hall to discuss a possible action. The stewards identified a large number of police informers in the audience and cancelled the meeting. A group of around 30 shop stewards withdrew to a public house on Sophienstrasse to discuss the matter. A proposal by Richard M\u00fcller for a general strike on 28 June was approved. The strike began the following morning with a coordinated withdrawal of labour at 35 factories, including those of Borsig, AEG, L\u00f6we and Schwartzkopff, which were then some of the largest engineering companies in the country. Word spread and other sites, including non-unionised factories, joined the strike. Some 55,000 workers in Berlin and several thousand in Stuttgart, Bremen, Braunschweig and Essen participated. The Potsdamer Platz demonstration continued into the day of the strike. SPD and DMV leaders spoke out against the strikes and handed out anti-strike leaflets to workers. At a meeting held ostensibly to encourage the strikers back to work socialist activist Sepp Oerter spoke angrily against the government and the war. The German authorities carried out a large number of house searches in response to the strike and increased the censorship of mail. Dozens of striking workers and union leaders were drafted into the army, including M\u00fcller, though he was released three months later. Liebknecht was tried and convicted. The unions did not carry out further strikes when he appeared in court again for his appeals and sentencing, perhaps because of the unexpectedly harsh measures meted out by the authorities in response to the first strike. \n\n## Legacy\n\n The strike was the first industrial action of national significance in Germany during the war and the socialist youth movement regarded it as the most important demonstration of the war years. The strike demonstrated the potential that the working class had to influence the war and marked the first time that unions had moved beyond industrial disputes into wider political matters. The strike led to the harsher treatment of Liebknecht by the authorities, on 23 August his sentence, originally for 2 years and 6 months of imprisonment with hard labour, was increased to four years and one month. Wages fell after the strike which the unions blamed on the industrial action, this caused workers to support the union leadership and oppose further strike action. A strike planned for August 1916 by the Spartacus League was not supported and had little impact. The union officials involved in the June 1916 strike became known as the Revolutionary Stewards. They played a key role in the organisation of a much larger strike in April 1917, in protest at a 25% cut in the bread ration. This strike mobilised 200-300,000 men and women in Berlin, Braunschweig, Dresden, Halle, Hanover and Magdeburg and had more of an anti-war theme than the 1916 strike. In the same month a new Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany was founded, becoming an umbrella organisation for anti-war movements in the country. The Revolutionary Stewards also organised the January 1918 strike protesting cuts in the flour ration and which openly called for peace, without German territorial expansion.", "1961\u201362 Irish Cup": "The 1961\u201362 Irish Cup was the 82nd edition of the Irish Cup, the premier knock-out cup competition in Northern Irish football.

He moved to Milan, where he practised law, at the same time teaching Greek and Latin at the Scuole Palatine. His friendship with the publisher Filippo Argelati triggered a period of literary scholarship. By 1721, he was employed full time as the principal proof reader for the Palatine Society, which had been formed to publish Muratori's \"Rerum Italicarum Scriptores\". In 1722 he was asked by the Ambrosian librarian, Giuseppe Antonio Sassi, to compare manuscript versions of the \"Historia miscella\" of Paul the Deacon with current printed editions and he spent many hours in the Ambrosian Library and chapter archives of Monza. Bianchi then became involved in developing commentaries on the text of some of the chronicles printed in the early volumes, such as those of Jordanes, Eutropius, and Paul the Deacon. His enthusiasm for the task brought him into conflict with both the Ambrosian librarian, Giuseppe Antonio Sassi, and with Muratori himself, who found his commentaries too long-winded. However, his edition of Paul the Deacon's \"Historia Langobardorum\" is rich in detail and precise, and draws on contemporary Greek and Latin historians and has been praised by later editors.. Delays in the production process from 1733 led to Bianchi being put on half pay, so he found a role in the Duchy of Milan's administration, culminating in his appointment as secretary of the Royal Council. He practised as a lawyer, and eventually held the posts of Professor of Municipal Law, Auditor General of the armies of the emperor in Italy, and perpetual Podest\u00e0 of Milan.

The other stopovers included the American cities of Seattle, Washington and Anchorage, Alaska, as well as Japan's capital Tokyo. The aircraft readied itself for the last leg of its journey to Manila and took of from Okinawa-Naha Airport at 1.12\u00a0am on July 14. Around two hours after takeoff at 3.15\u00a0am, engine no. 2 underwent a sudden loss of power which was indicated to the plane's crew by a drop in mean effective pressure and manifold pressure. The crew believed that the origin of the problem lay with Carburetor icing and so took action to correct the issue. When no improvement was made to the situation of engine no. 2, the captain noticed the oil-out temperature of the engine rising. The crew thereafter attempted to feather the propeller of engine no. 2, but failed numerous times. Following the ongoing engine troubles, the flight was cleard to descend from FL180 to FL100 . The crew declared an emergency at 3.40\u00a0am while descending to . In an effort to halt engine no. 2 rotation, the crew attempted to activate the firewall shutoff valve so the engine would be deprived of lubricant. As a result, the propeller separated from engine no. 2 and slashed a 15-inch (38.1\u00a0cm) hole in the plane's fuselage. More damage was reported by a continuous fire alarm, alerting the crew of a fire in engine no. 2 which had also spread to the wing. The crew informed Manila of their predicament at 4.20\u00a0am before the plane undertook a rapid descent which was lessened in intensity when the plane reached an altitude of . The crew had no choice but to ditch the aircraft in the Pacific Ocean about 124.7\u00a0km (77.5 miles) Northeast of Manila and 8\u00a0km (5 miles) Northeast off Polillo Island, Philippines. Upon hitting the water at 4.30\u00a0am, the tail of the aircraft sheared off alongside the right wing and all engines. The right wing remained afloat for three hours following the crash, working as a makeshift liferaft for many survivors. While the remainder of the aircraft sank between 8 and 10 minutes after the ditching. The survivors were ultimately rescued by the US Coast Guard and US Navy some four to six hours after the crash. Of the 58 passengers and crew, 57 survived with 44 suffering minor injuries. A single passenger died when the engine no. 2 propeller slashed through the plane's fuselage and struck her. \n\n## Aircraft\n\n The Douglas DC-7C involved, \"N292\" (msn 45462/925) was built in 1958 and was used by Northwest Orient Airlines from 1958 until its destruction in 1960. \n\n## Aftermath\n\n The aircraft was torn apart by the impact with the wreckage sinking to the bottom of the Pacific. An investigation of the accident concluded that an internal failure of the no. 2 engine had caused the plane's oil supply to be contaminated, resulting in a loss of oil supply and therefor the subsequent damage to the engine which ended with the propeller detaching after its assembly was disturbed, and engine fire that spread to the plane's wing, making a ditching of the aircraft necessary.", "Ollie Stonham": "Oliver Stonham is an English professional rugby union player, who currently plays as a flanker for Premiership Rugby side Saracens. \n\n## Early life\n\n Stonham attended Felsted School in Essex \u2013 the same school as future teammate and fellow Saracens academy graduate Max Malins \u2013 but did not play junior club rugby.

People with the surname are as follows:", "Neotraditionalism (politics)": "In politics and sociology, neotraditionalism is an approach using the deliberate application of old practices and institutions, modified to accommodate the modern context (this accommodation contrasts with primordialism). Neotraditionalists assert that the interaction between the state and society (governance, application of law, etc.) should take into account the cultural memory of the local population. Neotraditions can be invented outright with the purpose of creation of a new group identity thus being useful in the times of rapid changes in the society. As an example, Eric Hobsbawn offers the new Scottish national identity centered around Ossian, kilts, and bagpipes. This identity replaced in the 18th century the old feudal cohesion that was deteriorating under the pressure of urbanization and changes in the class system. Jonathan Friedman suggests that neotraditionalism is the opposite of modernism, rising up in the moments of crisis of the latter (such crises per Friedman are inevitable due to the need of the constant expansion required by modernism to simply maintain the stability). Traditional identity is something that one can rely on in times of crisis, providing an easily accessible set of rules for living and a medium for connection with others. Political scientists' use of the term varies. In particular, Communist neotraditionalism is used to describe a mix of modern and traditional elements in the USSR and other Communist countries, where the success of an individual to large extent depended on the archaic patron-client relations (including \"blat\"). The characterization of USSR as neo-traditionalist was pioneered by Ken Jowitt in 1983. A similar approach towards China was taken by Andrew Walder in his \"Communist Neo-Traditionalism\" (1988), where the communist neotraditionalism was defined as a \"distinctly modern\" fusion of communist institutions and personal patron/client ties. Matthew Lenoe and Terry Martin made the deep advances in research of the neotraditionalism in application to the Soviet history.

It was built and inaugurated, but never opened to the public. It was equipped with an advanced version of the SK system. \n\n## History\n\n \n\n## Origins of the Project\n\n The first project was announced in 1988 as part of promoter Christian Pellerin's \"Maille Horizon Complex\". The line was a double-track system, entirely underground, measuring 518 meters long and had two stations. The purpose of the people mover system was to allow easy access to the vast real estate project by ensuring a rapid and continuous link between the centre of the complex and the Noisy-le-Grand \u2013 Mont d'Est station on A Line of the \u00cele-de-France RER. On July 4, 1991, the \"Syndicat des transports parisiens\" (STP), predecessor of the \"Syndicat des transports d'\u00cele-de-France\" (STIF, now \u00cele-de-France Mobilit\u00e9s), authorized construction of the system. On July 30, 1991, the construction project was awarded to the Ligne Horizon company. In October 1991, was chosen to install, operate and maintain (for the lifetime of the project) the Noisy-le-Grand SK system. This was the first installation of an SK system in an urban environment. Construction work on the project was finished on February 22, 1993. Due to the bankruptcy of Christian Pellerin's project, the line was mothballed in November 1994. Regular maintenance was still performed and the system was run empty on a monthly basis, with an estimated annual cost of one million francs (150,000 euros). On October 7, 1999, the STP\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the termination of the operating concession and closed the system. \n\n## Abandonment of the Project\n\n This equipment belongs to the \"Public Development Establishments of Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e (\u00c9pamarne)\", under the French Government, which remains responsible for its possible demolition. The SK system was bought by the RATP in 1996; the RATP is responsible for maintenance. There are no plans to open the system, nor would it be feasible after having been shuttered for so long. According to local sources, the system and equipment were in relatively good condition until 2006. Since 2007, the station, the equipment and the electrical installations are regularly looted. In 2010, according to mayor Michel Pajon, the technology is obsolete, spare parts unavailable, the technical skills required to operate the system no longer exist and the transport cabins have not been maintained for five years. Also, the RATP refuses to provide details on maintenance costs for the system. The abandoned site is popular with urban explorers. \n\n## Future of the Site\n\n A study was undertaken in 2017 to determine the amount of asbestos used in the project's infrastructure, and the possible purchase of the remains by the city, for the symbolic cost of one euro. In July 2018, demolition started on the Mailles Horizon terminal station, in order to allow construction of housing on the land. However, the tunnel and the Mont d'Est station will not be removed.

He is one of the most-experienced co-drivers currently taking part in INRC for four-wheelers from 1992. Born in Secunderabad, Andhra Pradesh, Pai is a sound engineer by profession with over two decades of experience in the live sound industry and has over three decades of experience as a motor sports athlete. He started his motor sport career on motorcycles as a navigator and later moved to cars, also as a co-driver. He started his rallying career as a co-driver in 1992 and soon after caught the attention of big teams and drivers. He has since been co-driving for some of the best drivers from across India. \n\n## Motor Sports career\n\n 1992: Nikhil Pai started as a club-level rally co-driver in the year 1992 aboard a two-wheeler. His first break into the prestigious Indian National Rally Championship was in the same year when he was the co-driver for a private entry from Hyderabad. In 2002, Pai and Jiby Maliakkal from Mumbai dominated the 1400cc category and won the National Champion Co-Driver award in that category. The duo won their first Overall victory in the 2003 MRF India Rally. The partnership endured for a few more years despite repeated setbacks in different rallies. In 2005, Pai teamed up with Vikram Mathias, the 2004 National Overall Champion, as part of the Red Rooster Racing team and their debut for the new team resulted in a second-place finish in the prestigious K 1000 Rally, a round of the National Championship (INRC) and they also came third in Pine Forest Challenge Rally held in Chandigarh, also a round of INRC 2005.

Nikhil found a new partner in aspiring driver Sirish Chandran from Pune, the then editor of India's leading auto magazine, Overdrive. From 2010 onwards, the pair participated in a series of rallies, often bettering their own previous records. In 2016, Nikhil teamed up with Karna Kadur from Bengaluru. It was a turn-around year for the duo, winning not just the 2000cc category but also clinching the Overall National Rally Championship in their first year of partnership. In 2017, Nikhil and Karna Kadur finished 3rd in the Overall category of the Indian National Rally Championship.

The championships ran annually as part of ILTF Circuit until 1969.", "New York Daily News Building": "", "Onondaga Lake Parkway Bridge": "The Onondaga Lake Parkway Bridge is a truss bridge just outside the Syracuse, New York city limits that carries the St. Lawrence Subdivision railway freight line owned by CSX Transportation over a segment of New York State Route 370, known as the Onondaga Lake Parkway. The bridge has become infamous for a large number of commercial vehicles colliding with its deck, which rises just 10 feet 9 inches (3.28 m) above grade, while driving down this stretch of NY-370. \n\n## History\n\n Constructed in 1871 from wrought iron with \"substantial stone abutments,\" the bridge originally carried the rail line over what was then the Oswego Canal, with the first train traversing and testing the bridge on November 6 of that year. It was designed to sustain a distributed load of 230 tons and three tons in compression. A \"Syracuse Daily Journal\" reporter remarked upon its opening that the bridge was a \"beautiful, substantial, and permanent one; and what every railroad bridge should be.\" By the early 1900s, the canal was filled in at that point and boats instead took Onondaga Lake to connect to the enlarged and modernized Erie and Oswego canals. The roadway that would later become NY routes 20, 57, and finally 370 was constructed on the former canal bed as a scenic route along the newly established Onondaga Lake Park. \n\n## Collisions\n\n By the 1950s, the first reported collisions of commercial vehicles into the bridge's 10-foot-9-inch deck occurred in spite of a long-standing commercial vehicle ban, as the Onondaga Lake Parkway gradually turned from a leisurely route into a major thoroughfare route between Liverpool and Syracuse. This remains a common occurrence to this day, with the New York State Department of Transportation revealing that between 2020 and 2022, an average of just over 9 vehicles per year have struck the bridge, up from a normal average of 3 collisions per year. In March 2023, three trucks hit the bridge within a span of 12 days, including two within the last three days of the month. Commercial vehicles often rise 13-14 feet above the roadway, taller than the deck of the bridge. In addition, Onondaga County and state officials have cited commercial drivers using non-commercial GPS applications such as Google Maps and Apple Maps, which often route tuckers along the parkway and into the bridge. Concerns have been raised about the structural integrity of the bridge after several collisions, but the bridge has remained stable and in good condition as its wrought iron structure was \"remarkably well-constructed\". In 1996, Department of Transportation official Ray McDougall quipped that the bridge has \"won every one\" in regard to withstanding numerous collisions over the years. Despite the NYSDOT spending significant funds on countermeasures and warning signage, including up to $30 million between 2020 and early 2023, trucks have continued to crash into the bridge on a regular basis, often times driven by drivers from outside the area, and the recurring collisions into the bridge have inspired internet humor in the Syracuse area.  While many of the crashes have simply been nuisances to the public resulting in few to no injuries, with semi-trailer trucks scraping the bridge or breaking open and spilling their contents after hitting the bridge, a fatal accident occurred in 2010 when a Megabus double-decker bus hit the bridge, killing four passengers. A disaster was narrowly averted in 1992 when a 13-foot-tall tractor trailer wedged itself under the bridge while carrying 40,000 pounds of corrosive powder. \n\n## Efforts to improve the roadway\n\n After the 2010 Megabus crash, the NYSDOT installed an over-height vehicle detection system in the fall of 2011 in an attempt to more effectively enforce the commercial vehicle ban on the parkway and warn truckers to turn around. Truck drivers who ignore the warning signs and subsequently crash into the bridge are now ticketed. A study that was undertaken after the fatal 2010 Megabus crash showed that it was not feasible to raise the bridge or deepen the roadway, as the bridge is also owned by CSX and current geotechnical engineering rules prohibit the roadway from being below the water level of Onondaga Lake. CSX has stated that it is open to a project to raise the bridge if the state pays for it.", "Norton (constituency)": "Norton is a constituency of the National Assembly of the Parliament of Zimbabwe.

It is found in Africa within Zambia, inhabiting the tributary of the Kataba River, the Sianda stream, and a small tributary system in upper Zambia that joins the eastern side of the Barotse Floodplain. The species inhabits small streams near seasonally flooded plains that are bordered by open woodlands, living under dense floating mats of vegitation and emergent vegitation. It feeds on small aquatic invertebrates and grows to a length of 1.8 centimeters. \n\n## Conservation\n\n The population of \"Neolebias lozii\" is currently unknown as specimens are rare, with the type series having only 6 specimens, and only 19 specimens of the type locality being caught. Because of this there is no estimation of the current population size available, but is believed to be low due to its restricted range and little number of individuals being found. Threats of the species include urban development, agriculture, dams, modifications to the ecosystem, pollution, and droughts. The Kataba River is canalised upstream where the type locality are located, and no \"N. lozii\" specimens were found in the canalised section. The river faces similar threats to the Sianda stream, which was also canalised, likely to aid in agricultural drainage. The area around its range is increasing in human population, leading to an intensification of agriculture, water usage, and well as deforestation in nearby woodlands bordering dambos. Pollution by fertilizer and herbicides that leak into the water are likely to threaten the environment.

It is part of the Bow Range which is a subrange of the Canadian Rockies. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 1,240\u00a0meters (4,070\u00a0ft) above the Narao Lakes in . The nearest higher neighbor is Popes Peak, to the southeast on the Continental Divide. Precipitation runoff from Narao Peak drains into tributaries of the Kicking Horse River. The peak is visible from Highway 1 (the Trans-Canada Highway), and tourists en route to Lake O'Hara pass below the western base of the mountain. \n\n## History\n\n The first ascent of the summit was made in 1913 by the Interprovincial Boundary Survey which subsequently applied the toponym in 1916 based on the name given to the mountain by Samuel E.S. Allen. Samuel Evans Stokes Allen was a cartographer who mapped this area of the Rockies in the late 1800s and named many peaks. Mount Allen was named after him. The word \"narao\" translated from the Stoney language means \"hit in the stomach\", which may be related to an incident during the 1858 Palliser expedition when a spooked horse kicked James Hector unconscious near here, which also led to the name of Kicking Horse Pass. The mountain's toponym was officially adopted April 3, 1952, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. \n\n## Geology\n\n Narao Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods.

It was released on September 27, 2019 through Highline Entertainment. It was later nominated for Best R&amp;B Album at the Korean Music Awards and peaked at number 65 on the Gaon Album Chart. \n\n## Background\n\n In an interview with Genie Music, Sogumm explained how the album was made. &lt;blockquote&gt;Dress also made commercial music but wanted to express his feelings through beats without thinking too much. I worked with him because he requested a collaboration first, but I wrote songs quickly and he kept sending me beats. So we were planning to release one or two songs at first but made so many songs in an instant. The general public may find our music difficult but we were not asking for their understanding, so we named the album \"Not My Fault\" and decided on the album concept. &lt;/blockquote&gt; \n\n## Music and lyrics\n\n Sogumm's vocals that pronounce words differently are sometimes innocent(\"I Wonder\", \"Honey Bee\", \"Pretty Bitch\"), dry(\"Sorry\", \"Once Again\"), or magical(\"Diary\", \"Dreamer, Doer\"). Meanwhile, Dress' production encompasses hip hop, R&amp;B, and electronica. \"Diary\" is reminiscent of 90's trip hop sounds like those of Morcheeba. It tells the direction of the album with a down-tempo beat played with an analog drum set and piano, string, and guitar sounds distorted by an effects unit. \"Sorry\" emphasizes electronic sounds while \"Pretty Bitch\" solely features acoustic guitar sounds. \n\n## Critical reception\n\n Kang Il-gwon of \"Rhythmer\" rated the album 4 out of 5 stars and claimed that it was \"electrifying, excellent, and fresh\". On the other hand, he suggested that Sogumm write more lyrics in Korean. Critics of \"Music Y\" rated \"I Wonder\" 3.5 out of 5 stars. According to Jeong Byeong-uk, Dress \"knows how to use minimal sources in the right place and bring out the maximum amount of dreamlike atmosphere and groove.\" Also, Sogumm \"pronounces lyrics uniquely while reducing the resonance of the sound and shows her individuality with unconventional breathing and accents.\" Meanwhile, Jay Park balances out the intenseness of the hook by singing sweet lyrics in a natural style.", "Obliterated": "Obliterated is an upcoming American action dramedy streaming television series created by Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg, and Josh Heald.

The building, which was the principal prison for the local area was demolished in 1925. \n\n## History\n\n Newcastle Gaol was commissioned to replace the New Gate Gaol which dated from the 14th century. By 1820, that prison was described by the grand jury at Newcastle assizes \"as being out of repair and inconvenient, insufficient, and insecure.\" The site they chose for the new prison was Carliol Croft, a piece of open land in the east part of central Newcastle. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the mayor, Robert Bell, on 4 June 1823. It was designed by John Dobson in the Fortress Gothic Revival Style, built in ashlar stone at a cost of \u00a335,000 and was completed in February 1828. The design involved a tall entrance tower with a gateway, behind which there was an elliptical main prison building with six radiating wings in the style of a panopticon. Following the implementation of the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868, which abolished the practice of public executions, John William Anderson, who had been convicted of murdering his wife, became the first person to be executed inside the prison in December 1875. In order to increase the capacity of the prison, the radiating wings were demolished in 1858 to make way for a single four-storey prison block. Over-crowding increased in 1881, after Morpeth Gaol closed, and, by 1890, the building was accommodating 300 prisoners, three times as many as it was designed for, in very cramped conditions. Notable prisoners included the suffragette, Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton, who was tried and convicted of disorderly behaviour after she threw a stone at a ministerial car during a visit to Newcastle by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, in October 1909. She was sentenced to one month in the prison and was subjected to force-feeding while on hunger strike. John Dickman, who was convicted of murdering a wages courier on a train, became the last person to be executed in the prison, in August 1910. The constrained nature of the site meant there was very little room for expansion, and the prison was demolished in April 1925. The site was subsequently occupied by Telephone House, a structure commissioned to accommodate the Newcastle telephone exchange.", "Next Time Round": "\"Next Time Round\" is a song written by new wave musician Elvis Costello and recorded by Elvis Costello and the Attractions. The track was released on his 1986 album \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\" after an earlier attempt to record the song for his previous album \"King of America\" was scrapped. Featuring a sarcastic tone, \"Next Time Round\" employs classic rock and California Sound-esque musical elements. It has since been positively received by critics and appeared in Costello's live setlists. \n\n## Background\n\n Like several other songs on \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\", \"Next Time Round\" was attempted by Costello during the sessions for his previous 1986 album \"King of America\", but this version would ultimately be scrapped. In addition to recording an aborted demo at Red Bus Studios in London, Costello tried to record the song during the sessions with his longtime backing band the Attractions. These sessions would be fraught with tension and only the recordings of \"Suit of Lights\" and the B-side \"Baby's Got A Brand New Hairdo\" would see release. Costello described this version of \"Next Time Round\" as \"lacklustre\" and noted the song woulld \"have to wait until the \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\" sessions to be more fully realised.\" When Costello reunited with the Attractions to record \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\", he decided to revive \"Next Time Round\" for a recording that was \"amplified and roughed up by the deliberately crude Olympic sound.\" He explained, \"The more sarcastic tone of 'Next Time Round' had ... not found a place on the previous record, but it now provided a rave-up finale for an album that stays mostly in the dark.\" Costello further noted that this new recording exhibited traces of the California Sound in its backing vocals. \n\n## Release and reception\n\n \"Next Time Round\" was released as the final track on \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\" in September 1986. Author Frankin Bruno noted the song as one of the many \"rave-ups\" that Costello used to close albums, playing a similar role to songs like \"The World and His Wife\" on \"Punch the Clock\" and \"Radio Radio\" on \"This Year's Model\". \"Next Time Round\" was not released as a single. \"Next Time Round\" has seen positive reception from music writers. In a 1986 review of \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\", \"Spin Magazine\" described the song as \"a truly towering fit of persecution mania with a great melody and a good beat.\" \"Rolling Stone\" praised it as \"suicidal, iron-fisted Merseybeat,\" while the \"Montreal Gazette\" dubbed it a \"scalding last put-down.\" Author James Perone commented, \"Although this song is not among those that find their names on lists of 'Elvis's greatest,' it is a solid example of Costello's rock-song craftsmanship.\" \n\n## Live history\n\n \"Next Time Round\" has made intermittent appearances in Costello's live setlist since its release. Costello has noted that these live takes often accentuate the California Sound characteristics that were hinted at in the studio version; he specifically highlights a performance during his \"Spinning Wheel\" tour, where members of the Bangles made a guest appearance and provided Mamas and Papas-inflected backing vocals. \n\n## Cover versions\n\n \"Next Time Round\" was covered by Canadian rock band the Trews. \n\n## References\n\n Citations Sources", "National Biodiversity Pavilion": "The National Biodiversity Pavillion (in spanish Pabell\u00f3n Nacional de la Biodiversidad of the National Autonomous University of Mexico) is a Mexico's museum oriented towards showing the national biodiversity in Mexico.

The monument consists of the remains of Nevay Church and its burial grounds, excluding the boundary walls.", "Nota Greenblatt": "Rabbi Nota Greenblatt (1925-2022) was a world-renowned misader gittin, co-founder of the Memphis Hebrew Academy in Memphis, Tennessee, and the leader of the Vaad HaKehilloth of Memphis. \n\n## Torah Education\n\n Rav Nota was born to a family with strong roots in the Torah world of Brisk, his father Rabbi Yitzchak Greenblatt being close with Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik and his son Rabbi Velvel. After spending most of his childhood in British Mandate Palestine, where he crossed paths with the likes of Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kook, Rav Nota and his family moved back to the US when he was 13, where he enrolled in Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim under the tutelage of Rabbi Dovid Leibowitz. Despite his young age, he became one of the prominent students of the Yeshiva. At the age of 16, Rav Nota befriended Rabbi Yechiel Michel Feinstein, learning under him and Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik in the short-lived Heichal Rabbeinu Chaim HaLevi in Boston. It is there where Rav Nota honed his Brisker methodology which he would employ in his Torah learning and teaching for the rest of his life. At the age of 17, Rav Nota enrolled in the Yeshiva of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, Mesivta Tiferes Yerushalayim, with whom he forged a very close bond. It is there where Rav Nota learned a way in life and Halakhic decision-making. Rav Nota also continued to learn with Rabbi Yechiel Michel in the Yeshiva there, until 1946, when they both made their way to Palestine to learn under the Brisker Rav. The Brisker Rav was not well at the time, although Rav Nota seized every opportunity to learn from him. He also took this time to learn with Rabbi Aharon Cohen, the Rosh Yeshiva of Chevron, as well as Rabbi Leib Shachor. He also managed to forge bonds with other great Torah luminaries in Palestine at the time, such as the Chazon Ish, Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer, and the Imrei Emes of Gur. Rav Nota gave up an opportunity to marry the daughter of Rav Moshe Bernstein and succeed him as Rosh Yeshiva of Kaminetz Yeshiva in Palestine, deferring it to Rabbi Yitzchak Scheiner, who Rav Nota had taken under his wings in those years. He returned to America in 1948 with his ailing Father, eager to make an impact.  \n\n## Founding of the Memphis Hebrew Academy\n\n Rav Nota would find his niche in the fledgling Jewish community of Memphis, Tennessee, where he first settled alone as a bachelor to fill the role of chazzan at a local synagogue and teacher in the local Talmud Torah. Already within a year of his arrival, Rav Nota, along with local resident Seymour Kutner, embarked on the daunting task of establishing a fully operational Jewish day school for the community. After going door to door to plea with practically every Jewish household in the city, in September of 1949, they managed to open a school of 38 children for kindergarten and first grade, where Rav Nota taught without taking a cent from the School. The School, which would later blossom into a fully functional K-12 institution known as the Margolin Hebrew Academy, would continue to grow and flourish under the watch of Rav Nota, producing many Torah observant Jews and pumping the Jewish community with religious vitality. Even as Rav Nota gave up his teaching role in the school, he still played an active advisory role, and was invested in the spiritual growth of all its students. He also would play an active role in overseeing all Halakhic aspects of daily Jewish life in the community.  Rav Nota would go on to marry a local resident of the community, Miriam Kaplan. They would have five children together.  \n\n## Siddur Gittin\n\n While in Memphis, Rav Nota would also volunteer to take on the role of dealing with divorces in the Jewish community according to the Halakha. This eventually became not just a local effort, but a national, and sometimes even international undertaking, travelling across the globe to administer Gittin. Rav Nota paid for his travel expenses from his own pocket, and his endless travels would take up a significant portion of his days.  In 2015, Rav Nota permitted a woman to re-marry despite never receiving a get from her previous husband (who had refused to do so) on the questionable grounds of \"kiddushei taos\". This decision was criticized by many prominent Rabbis, but nevertheless, Rav Nota never rescinded his decision. \n\n## Torah Impact\n\n Although he did not teach in the school in Memphis for many years, Rav Nota's impact on the Memphis Jewish community was enormous, whether it be in overseeing Halakhic observance, investment in the personal spiritual growth of its residents, or delivering Torah lectures in the community. In 2014, in his old age, as he started winding down in his tireless siddur Gittin efforts, Rav Nota set his sights on founding a Kollel in Memphis, where he would teach top young Torah Scholars from across the country. Rav Nota would continue to deliver shiurim to his Kollel and the Community until the deterioration of his health in his late 90's. Like most Briskers, Rav Nota was reserved about publicizing his Torah novelties. He only published one sefer in his lifetime at the behest of his children - \"K'Reiach Sadeh\" (1999), with an approbation by his mentor, Rabbi Yechiel Michel Feinstein. The sefer contains concise sharp inferences and insights into the words of the Chumash and Rashi with a Halakhic emphasis. Rav Nota passed away in New York on April 29, 2022. He was buried in the Mount Judah Cemetery in Queens in the Brisker section.", "Obosomase Akuapem": "Obosomase is a town in the Akuapim South Municipal District of the Eastern Region of south Ghana.

Located in an oak forest about a kilometre northeast of Kurja\u010de, Serbia, the monastery with the church dedicated to the Transfer of the Relics of Saint Nicholas of Mirliki represents as a whole an immovable cultural asset as a cultural monument. \n\n## History\n\n The name of the monastery probably comes from the Vlach word \"nimik\" (\"unknown\", \"unfamiliar\") after an unknown saint whose grave is located in the Chapel of the Sanctuary next to the church. The elders of the monastery were Paraskeva Jovanovi\u0107, Ilarija Sretenovi\u0107 and Jefrosinija Milanovi\u0107, the abbess who is most responsible for the restoration of this monastery. According to tradition, the church was built by Duke Bogosav after 1376, when the area of northern Brani\u010devo belonged to Prince Lazar. Nimnik is first mentioned as a metoch of Ravanica monastery in the Ravanica charter, and in Turkish tax books from the first half of the 16th century. In his report from 1733/34. Maksim Ratkovi\u0107 describes a very old church, built of stone, with a stone vault, unpainted and covered with shingles. It had an iconostasis on which the imperial doors and two icons of the throne stood out due to their exceptional beauty and age, which he says are not found in any other monastery. Nimnik was burned and demolished during the Ko\u010dina Krajina and after the First Serbian Uprising, and was largely rebuilt in 1825, as evidenced by Joakim Vuji\u0107. Then the church was rebuilt from hard material, with a wooden vault and a brick floor. A Bell tower was built in front of the church in 1841, and an inn was built to the northwest of the church where, in 1851\u20131853, year, one of the first schools in the region operated. The building had a porch and three rooms, two of which were classrooms. \n\n## Church architecture\n\n The Nimnik monastery church is a single-nave building, vaulted with a semi-circular vault, with a semicircular altar apse in the width of the nave to the east. Throughout history, it has undergone numerous demolitions and reconstructions, so its current appearance is from the time of reconstruction in the 19th century. In 1891, the walls made of crushed stone were covered with bricks, which can still be seen on the facades of the church today. One part of the building material comes from the Roman site of Viminacium, as evidenced by the built-in fragments of the capital of a marble column with a beautiful female head, with lush, parted hair, which served as a source of belief for the uninformed, that it was the figure and head of a child they killed because it did not want to show them the Nimnik church. The iconostasis is classically designed with fourteen icons arranged in three zones. It originates from the time of the restoration of the church at the end of the 19th century and is the work of the painter Milisav Markovi\u0107. Their value lies in their quality, antiquity and the hand of the artist who made them, with a considerable influence of Romanian influence in Orthodox iconography. The last renovation was at the end of the 20th century, when, among other things, the temple was painted, and the old inn was demolished. It originates from the time of the restoration of the church at the end of the 19th century and is the work of the painter Milisav Markovi\u0107. \n\n## The legend of the origin\n\n Nimnik Monastery has two chapels. The first one is called Svetinja and is located on the grave of a girl who, according to tradition, was killed by the Turks because she did not want to show them the way to the monastery. According to this tradition, the monastery was named Nimnik.[3] The second chapel is located in the monastery dormitory and is dedicated to the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In its long past, the Nimnik monastery was almost constantly in the role of the parish church of the village of Kurja\u010de, until 1938, when it was turned into a women's monastery and remains so until today. In 1939, there were 30 members (nuns and young novices), under the abbess of the monastery, Mother Paraskeva.

Just like other ctenophores, over 95% of its body mass and composition is water. \n\n## Physical description\n\n \"Callianira antarctica\" studied in 2002 ranged in size from 35mm to 83.6mm in Autumn months, and from 8.5mm to 98mm in Winter months. Their weight ranged from 150\u00a0mg to 758\u00a0mg in Autumn, and in Winter they ranged from 2.8\u00a0mg to 1366\u00a0mg. \n\n## Distribution\n\n \"Callianira antarctica\" has been found in the waters of Southern Chile and Argentina, specifically the Strait of Magellan and Beagle Channel. It has also been studied and observed in Antarctic waters in the Croker Passage and Marguerite Bay. It resides in water depths ranging from 30m to 400m, but through sampling it was seen that the highest abundance of ctenophores was found to be between 120-150m during the day, and about 250m at night. \n\n## Ecology\n\n \"Callianira antarctica\" is carnivorous, and primarily hunts copepods, but during winter months will eat pteropods, and larval/juvenile krill. Observed specimens gut contents show that they feed on species such as Calanoides acutus, \"Limacina helicina,\" \"Calanus propinquus\", \"metridia gerlachi\", and larval/juvenile \"Euphausia superba\". \"C. antarctica\" was observed to have a seasonal feeding on krill larvae that takes place underneath the sea ice. \"C. antarctica\" hunts by swimming in a circle pattern under the ice with its tentacles outstretched. \"C. antarctica's\" tentacles use colloblasts which stick prey to the tentacles. Then \"C. antarctica\" would retract the tentacle into its mouth and down to its gut where digestion would occur. Typically \"C. antarctica\" would hunt underneath the sea ice and swim horizontally, but some have been seen attached to the ice while hunting, and instead would hang their tentacles straight down to catch prey. Digestion in observed specimens took anywhere from 5 hours to 46 hours. \"Callianira antarctica\" was seen egesting the hard exoskeletons of its prey after digesting the soft insides. \"C. antarctica\" needs carbon and lipids from its prey to survive, and it is thought that these needs increase during the winter months, and when in the juvenile stage of life. Unlike \"Mertensia ovum\", \"Callianira antarctica\" has no oil sacs, and instead stores lipids in the stomodeum. Body carbon is distributed among tentacles, the gut wall, and comb rows.", "Cape Town Street Circuit": "Cape Town Street Circuit is a street circuit laid out on the city streets of Cape Town, South Africa.

In February 1940, he was posted to 18th British General Hospital at \u00c9taples. In May 1940, he attempted to evacuate casualties to Boulogne, but was captured by the Germans. In 1942, several months after arriving at Colditz, he was summoned to Berlin to meet with Subhas Chandra Bose (on 23 June 1942). There he was invited to join the Free India Legion. Although he was a supporter of India's independence, Mazumdar refused the offer because he had pledged an oath of allegiance to King George VI. Mazumdar was returned to Colditz. He realised that his best chance of escaping would be to get transferred to an all Indian camp in France where security would be more lax. To achieve this, he staged a hunger strike in February 1943. After two weeks, Mazumdar was too weak to leave his bed but remained resolute. After 16 days the Germans agreed to a transfer. This gesture won him the respect of his fellow British prisoners.

It is located within a camping site within the grounds of Bucknowle Farm. \n\n## History\n\n The first villa was constructed on the site during the late 1st century AD. A large aisled hall and a possible bath house were built during the first phase of construction. The aisled hall remained in use until at least the mid 2nd to early 3rd centuries before being rebuilt, and also around this time, a new bath house was constructed alongside six timber-framed buildings which were most likely farm buildings or workshops. By the late 3rd century, many of the wooden buildings had been rebuilt and enlarged and a new domestic block built up from three rooms was now the largest building on the site, and excavations found roof and flue tiles alongside limestone slabs used for the floor. During the 4th century, the site contained three large buildings and a bath house, and the wooden buildings went out of use by the year 300 AD. On the site of the wooden buildings was a large building separate from the two other ranges, and excavations revealed that it had heated floors, mosaic pavements and a tessellated floor. It was also connected to the bath house and the second aisled hall, making it the main domestic range of the villa complex. When the Romans withdrew from Britain in 410 AD, the villa complex was abandoned shortly after and the site was eventually reverted back to farmland during the Anglo-Saxon era.  Bucknowle House was eventually built on the site of the villa complex. \n\n## Excavation\n\n A number of Romano-British sites have been discovered and studied on the Isle of Purbeck.

Moreover, beneath these, a more complicated system of Iron Age and early Roman Age habitation was uncovered, including the remains of Iron Age graves.

Following the capture of Sollum on 14 March the British discovered evidence that the prisoners, survivors from two ships sunk by a German U-boat, were being held at the Bir Hakeim oasis, about to the west. A rescue force of armoured cars and ambulances was assembled by Major Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster. The force, starting before dawn, drove across the desert and surprised the Senussi guards. On finding the prisoners had been half-starved during their 135 days' captivity the British pursued the fleeing Senussi and massacred most of them, including women and children. The party then returned to Sollum. \n\n## Background\n\n The Allies and the Central Powers had been engaged in the First World War since 1914. As Caliph of the Islamic faith, the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed V had some influence over the Senussi, Bedouin pastoralists of Italian Libya and the western portion of British Egypt. The Senussi were inspired to revolt against the colonial powers in November 1915 and occupied part of the coast and oases of the Sahara Desert, starting the Senussi campaign. The British formed the Western Frontier Force (WFF, Major-General William Peyton) to fight the Senussi. From February the British were reinforced by troops freed by the evacuation of Gallipoli. The British defeated the main Senussi force on the coast at the Action of Agagia on 26 February but parts of the coast to the west and the oases in the interior remained under Senussi control. On 14 March the British re-occupied Sollum on the coast, to the west of Agagia, near the Libyan border. A mobile force, the Light Armoured Car Brigade (Major Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster), had played an important part, being directed in its movements by aircraft. Westminster's force consisted of three batteries of Rolls-Royce Armoured Cars, equipped with powerful engines and a revolving machine gun turret. \n\n## Prelude\n\n When the British re-occupied Sollum, by a stroke of luck, a letter sent by Captain R. S. Gwatkin-Williams, the commander of \"Tara\", to Sollum when he was ignorant that the British had withdrawn from the town, was found in a house. The contents of the letter indicated the whereabouts of the survivors of the crews of the armed boarding steamer \"Tara\" (formerly ) and the horse transport , ships sunk by a German U-boat in the Mediterranean in November 1915. The WFF intelligence officer, Captain Leopold Royle, questioned the Senussi prisoners and established that the crews of the ships were at Bir Hakeim. Bir Hakeim was the name of the site of two Roman wells, a tomb and an Ottoman blockhouse about west of Sollum. The (well) did not appear on British maps but two Arab guides with the British claimed to know its location. Westminster and Peyton decided on a rescue attempt. Royle had knowledge of the area from his pre-war service with the Egyptian Coastguard and knew that the first of the desert was traversable by motor car. Westminster gathered a force of 45 vehicles for the raid. The vehicles comprised nine armoured cars, plus his Rolls-Royce touring car and a number of un-armoured trucks and Ford ambulances. \n\n## Rescue\n\n Departing from Sollum at around 3.00 a.m. on 17 March, the group made the first part of the journey by moonlight. The party made fast progress despite the going varying from soft sand to ground strewn with boulders. With the assistance of the guides, the party reached Bir Hakeim around 12 hours later, having covered . The attack was led by the armoured car of Lieutenant William Griggs. The Senussi guards were surprised and fled, pursued by two of the cars. The prisoners thought the war was over and the cars were bringing news of the armistice. When the cars opened fire on the nine fleeing guards and their families who were mixed among them, Gwatkin-Williams was surprised and attempted to intervene, shouting \"Save them, they have been kind to us\". Gwatkin-Williams's intervention failed, despite the efforts of the Duke of Westminster to halt the firing. An armoured car driver, Sam Rolls, who wrote of the event in his 1937 memoir \"Steel Chariots in the Desert\", stated that the British were shocked by the sight of the prisoners, whose 135 days of half-starvation in captivity had left them \"living skeletons\" and took vengeance on the Senussi. He describes the cars shooting down men, women and children with only two babies surviving. The intentional killing of non-combatants was a contravention of the First Geneva Convention (1864). The British official historian, George Macmunn, wrote in 1928 that the prisoners had suffered some ill-treatment but had not been treated badly given the local customs. Macmunn wrote that the lack of food was unsurprising given the famine that was engulfing the Senussi. Four of the prisoners had died, mainly due to hunger and the survivors had suffered from illness, dysentery, lice and effects of the hot days and cold nights. Within half an hour of their arrival the British loaded the 92 surviving prisoners into the trucks and ambulances and began their return to British-held territory. The party arrived at Sollum 22 hours after they had left, having covered . The British force suffered no casualties and described the raid as having proceeded \"without incident\". The rescued prisoners were sent to Alexandria in Egypt, on the SS \"Rasheed\" for treatment before being returned to Britain. \n\n## Aftermath\n\n The historian Charles Stephenson, writing in 2014, said the raid could not have been achieved by any means available at the time except for the armoured cars. Westminster was appointed to the Distinguished Service Order for his work in the raid. Fighting in the Senussi campaign continued at the oases in the interior of Egypt until February 1917 when a victory by a British force equipped with armoured cars at the Siwa Oasis ended Senussi resistance.", "Bo Lindgren": "Bo Waldemar Lindgren (26 February 1927 \u2013 4 June 2011) was a Swedish Grandmaster and chess composer.

Edwin Howard, a regionally prominent architect. Architects Ralph H. Burt Jr. (1923\u20132005) and Alva L. Hill Jr. (1920\u20132015) were both natives of Pennsylvania and attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh with the class of 1952 before joining Howard &amp; Murphy in Butler. In 1958 they became partners in the reorganized Howard, Burt &amp; Hill. In 1966 the firm was incorporated, and in 1968 Howard retired. Burt and Hill continued the firm as Burt, Hill &amp; Associates. Under Burt and Hill's leadership the firm rapidly expanded, opening offices in Pittsburgh in 1971 and Fort Myers, Florida, in 1973. In 1978 it was reorganized as Burt Hill Kosar Rittelmann Associates to reflect the admission of John E. Kosar and E. Richard Rittelmann (1938\u20132015) to the partnership. In the 1970s the office became noted for solar design under the leadership of Burt and his associate, Rittelman. Their first major project in this area was the retrofitting of the 1962\u2013built George A. Towns Elementary School in Atlanta with a solar heating and cooling system in association with the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1975. This has been removed but in its time was the largest such installation in the United States. Another large solar project was Comstock Center in Pittsburgh, completed in 1985. Burt and Hill retired in 1989, but the firm continued to expand. By the early 1990s it had additional offices in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Houston and was noted as the largest architectural firm in Western Pennsylvania. In 1998 it expanded internationally with an office in Dubai, and in 2005 was renamed a final time to Burt Hill Architects. The firm invested heavily in its international practice, and faltered after the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis led to the suspension of many proposed projects in the Persian Gulf.

Specifically identifying family members of the \"Pyrodictium\" genus, many examples have been examined from hydrothermal marine locations which harbor temperatures of 80-110 degrees Celsius. When observed in close proximity, cannula appear hollow.Unfortunately the cannula are not well understood or studied.  \n\n## Physical Structure\n\n Cannula function as an intracellular connection of periplasmic spaces between differing cells. Although this is the physical function, the network function is still not clear. It has been hypothesized that this network connection might be used to exchange genetic material or nutrients, which could contribute to the cells ability to survive unfavorable conditions. At present time there is very little known about the inner working of the cannula tubule and what might happen there. When observed in close proximity, cannula appear hollow with a diameter of 25\u00a0nm that can grow up to 40\u00a0mm long. They have been found to be resistant to high heat conditions and many forms of denaturing agents. This has been proven by observing no morphological changes when subjected to high temperatures and sodium dodecyl sulfate. The physical makeup of cannula are consistent with three different and homologous glycoprotein subunits that have different masses of 20, 22, and 24 kDa. This unique makeup and the identification of only belonging to archaeon-specific cells are a novel finding that could possibly contribute to finding out new information about the assembling structures of prokaryotes function. \n\n## Cannula expansion\n\n It is found that the growth of these networks is directly related to cell division. When a cell of this type undergoes division, the two resulting daughter cells remain connected to their parental cell via these tubules, which exponentially grows the network structure with the division. This means that each cell has multiple cannula connections in a dense form. Specimens of this nature have been studied in laboratories where cultures have been maintained for up to 20 years, but in this 20 years they have never been able to produce a strain that does not grow the cannula. This suggests vital necessity and the lack of evolution without cannula. In a similar form, biofilm structures are known to produce antibiotic resistance and other cell-favorable evolutions as they are in close proximity for horizontal gene transfer. There is theory that this is why these tubes exist between cells in order to form evolution with offspring. \n\n## Physical location\n\n As cannulae is still a very unknown phenomenon, it has not been found in many locations. A location is has been found is near the studied black smoker emitting sulfide rich vents. These are located near the mid-atlantic ridge. Cannulae are found to make up a large portion of the biomass of the \"Pyrodictium\" cultures that have been found to date. Current growth conditions show that these cells are grown in anoxic conditions, further assisting that these hollow tubes might be used to transport nutrients in a nutrient poor environment for survival.

By 2012, Brookfield and Johnson Controls had become an established industry leader with 11,500 locations across Canada. In 2013, Johnson Controls and Brookfield Asset Management formed a similar joint venture in Australia and New Zealand. In 2007, Brookfield Asset Management acquired the Multiplex, an Australian international construction contracting company founded in 1962 by John Roberts. which was valued at that time at approximately A$7.3 billion. It was renamed Brookfield Multiplex in 2016. In 2012 Brookfield Asset Management and Johnson Controls Global WorkPlace Solutions (GWS) merged to create Brookfield Johnson Controls. \n\n## Mergers and acquisitions\n\n In 2015, Brookfield Johnson Controls was renamed Brookfield Global Integrated Solutions (BGIS), with Brookfield Asset Management as the ultimate parent company when it acquired control of Brookfield Johnson Controls from its joint venture partner, Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls. At that time, an activist investor had been putting pressure on Johnson Controls to divest of its real estate division. Brookfield Asset Management rebranding of BGIS reflected the integration of \"facilities and project management services business in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The facilities management business was renamed Brookfield Global Integrated Solutions (BGIS) as part of Brookfield's plan to establish a \"leading global facilities management provider\".

It was published on November 8, 2022 by Simon &amp; Schuster Books for Young Readers and has been called \"a worthy successor\" to its predecessor, \"Legendborn.\" \"Bloodmarked\" picks up the story one month after the events at the end of \"Legendborn\", with Bree and her friends recovering from battle and preparing to locate and rescue Nick Davis, Bree's boyfriend and the Scion of Lancelot. \n\n## Plot summary\n\n \"Bloodmarked\" begins with Nick Davis, Bree's boyfriend and the Scion of Lancelot, missing after being kidnapped by his father and Bree confined to her room in the Lodge for her protection. Bree, frustrated and stir crazy, sneaks out to practice her magic. Selwyn Kane, a Merlin tasked with keeping Bree and the rest of the Order of the Round Table safe, discovers she has left her room. They are soon attacked by demons, and Bree is removed from the battle by an unknown entity who turns out to be a member of the Mageguard, \"the elite military unit of the Order's forces.\" The Mageguard have arrived at the Lodge to ensure its safety before the arrival of the Council, who will be attending the memorial service for those who lost their lives during the battle one month earlier. After the memorial, the Mageguard initiates the Rite of Kings, during which Bree is expected to complete the Oath and claim her title of King. During the Rite, Bree sees Nick in Lancelot's place and turns down the Oath. Her vision of the Round Table changes into that of her ancestral stream, where she sees Vera, her ancestor, before waking again in the ogof where she began the Rite of Kings. She is briefly aware of her surroundings before feeling a syringe plunged into her neck and falling unconscious. Bree awakes repeatedly to the Council members asking her questions about her mother and her powers. The first time she is fully aware, she is being treated by her friend William, who tells her the Rite was an ambush and that the Council has been holding the two of them in a facility for three days, controlled by a serum that subdues their powers. They have been mesmering Bree as well, William tells her, and she is finally able to resist the mesmer through pain, as she has in the past. Two more days pass before Bree is aided in a breakout conducted by members of the Order who are still loyal to her, along with her friend Alice. Bree, Alice, William, Sel (rescued from a separate facility), and their three allies board a plane and travel to a safe house. On the plane, Bree has another vivid dream/vision in which she is able to communicate with Nick. At the safe house, Bree is attacked by a goruchel, one of the strongest types of demons. The group discovers that their host made a deal with the demon, wanting her to kill Bree, which would cut off the bloodlines and effectively end the Order of the Round Table. Before they kill the demon, Sel and Bree interrogate her, and she reveals that there is a demon referred to as \"The Great Devourer,\" \"who hunts humans for power.\" This makes Bree think of a man she had seen in visions sent to her by her ancestors, known by them as the Hunter. Leaving the safe house behind, Bree, William, Alice, and Sel end up at a bar for magical beings. There, they meet Valec, a demon who sets up deals between demons and humans, acting as a broker and monitoring the magic used in the bar. When he discovers how powerful Bree is, he introduces her to another Rootcrafter, who agrees to allow the group to stay with her for some time. Once at her home, Bree has another vision of Nick, which cuts off when he appears frightened by something and reveals his location to her. She relays the message to Sel, and the two of them go to rescue Nick. From afar, they watch as Nick's father is struck by a spear meant for Nick. In retaliation, Nick beheads the Merlin who threw the spear. Nick catches sight of Bree and Sel, shaking his head before disappearing into the woods in the opposite direction. Bree and Sel are attacked by Erebus, but they are able to fight him off. Shortly after, Valec appears to take them back to their new safe house, before they are attacked by demons. Bree very nearly dies, but Valec is able to bring William back to her in time. Feeling that they are no longer safe at their current base, the group travels to Volition, whose grounds are protected by ancient Rootcraft. There, Bree practices summoning aether and using her root interchangeably. The Mageguard find where they are staying and plan to take Bree as their prisoner. Bree decides to use the power of Arthur to fight them off, but Arthur takes over her body, pushing her consciousness into the maze of memories Arthur had been living in for centuries. Arthur is determined to maintain corporeality, while Bree is determined to find her way out of his subconscious. Sel and Nick, as Merlin and Lancelot, help Bree reemerge. The effort of this causes Sel to devolve and lose most of his human characteristics to the point where he most closely resembles a demon. Bree realizes that the \"Great Devourer,\" the demon feared by other demons, with whom her ancestor Vera made a blood pact, is someone she knows: Erebus. Bree decides to let his curse die with her. She makes a pact with him: she will go with him if he finds Selwyn's mother, the only Merlin who may be powerful enough to restore Sel's humanity. \n\n## Themes\n\n While \"Legendborn\" focused heavily on Bree's grief over losing her mother, and \"Bloodmarked\" is \"a very intentional continuation of grief,\" the second installment of Deonn's series delves deeper into other themes as well. In an interview with \"Shondaland\", Deonn noted that she wanted to write a book \"engaging with, deeply understanding, analyzing, holding on to, [and] reshaping your own Blackness in spaces where it\u2019s being challenged or dismissed by other people\" as well as \"the types of stories and the type of people that become legendary,\" and the role of the history of Black people and enslavement in America in creating these legends. \n\n## Reception\n\n \"Bloodmarked\" has been well-received by critics and audiences. It was an instant New York Times Bestseller, debuting at number one and spending ten weeks on the Young Adults Hardcover Best Seller List. Similarly, it has appeared on the Kids Indie Next List in the Young Adult category. It has received many positive reviews, including a Kirkus review calling the book \"a worthy successor to an explosive debut.\" Deonn is also lauded for her \"commitment to presenting unflinching truths about the cyclical insidiousness of racism,\" which is an undeniable theme throughout \"Bloodmarked\". A \"School Library Journal\" review calls the book \"a must for all library collections.\"", "Birut\u0117 (opera)": "Birut\u0117 is a two-act opera composed by Mikas Petrauskas based on the play by Gabrielius Landsbergis-\u017demkalnis. It was first performed on 6 November 1906 in Vilnius and became the first Lithuanian national opera. The plot is based on the medieval legend about the love between Birut\u0117 and Grand Duke of Lithuania K\u0119stutis recorded in the Lithuanian Chronicles. The opera was written for the amateur Lithuanian performers and thus is mostly valued for its historical significance. \n\n## Plot\n\n The opera is set during the 14th-century Lithuanian Crusade. Winrich von Kniprode, komtur of the Teutonic Order, wishes to marry Birut\u0117, daughter of the ruler of Palanga. In Act I, von Kniprode sends his envoys to persuade Birut\u0117's father to agree to the marriage. If persuasion and gifts fail, they are prepared to take her by force. Birut\u0117 weeps and asks her father to kill her instead. However, \"krivi\u0173 krivaitis\" (chief pagan priest) Lizdeika decrees that it is the will of the gods for Birut\u0117 to become a \"vaidilut\u0117\" (pagan priestess similar to Roman vestales). In Act II, as Birut\u0117 prepares to be initiated, an old \"vaidila\" (priest or prophet) makes a prophesy that Birut\u0117 is destined to become the mother of a giant who will defeat the Teutonic Order (veiled reference to her son Grand Duke Vytautas and the Battle of Grunwald). Grand Duke K\u0119stutis arrives to the scene and becomes captivated by Birut\u0117. He learns that the plan for her to become a \"vaidilut\u0117\" is only a means to avoid the marriage to the Teutonic komtur, interrupts the initiation ceremony, and proposes to Birut\u0117. As she agrees, a choir starts praising the homeland. \n\n## Analysis\n\n \"Birut\u0117\" is a two-act opera similar to a singspiel. It has 12 music numbers connected by spoken dialogues. Such structure reflects realities of the amateur Lithuanian theater in 1906. It was intended for a one-time performance by a group of amateurs. There was no permanent troupe, orchestra, or premises. Therefore, the music could not be long or complex. Additionally, Mikas Petrauskas, while a graduate of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, was not trained in composition. He composed the music in a few weeks while hiding from the Tsarist police. Therefore, the opera has hurried and amateurish components. In his study of the opera, Vytautas Landsbergis concluded that the opera is not very artistic, but is valuable for its historical significance during the Lithuanian National Revival and the early stages of the Lithuanian theatre. Music numbers are traditional operatic (arias, ariosos) or popular (polonaises, mazurkas) compositions that have little in common with the Lithuanian folk songs. They reveal character's feelings, goals, or view of the events. The opera opens with an aria by Birut\u0117 which is based on laments and at one point switches to melodeclamation. Birut\u0117's second aria is perhaps most valuable and artistic. After meeting K\u0119stutis, she sings about her feelings that grow from a dream into an open declaration of love. In contrast, K\u0119stutis does not sing a single line. One of the most popular numbers is a song by the old \"vaidila\" with a women's choir. Petrauskas used arpeggio chord to create a serious and epic-sounding melody in leisurely tempo. Both acts end with solemn but uplifting songs by choirs that summarize the events. For songs by the choir of \"vaidilut\u0117s\", Petrauskas attempted to create a sense of antiquity by using noble melody, asymmetric period structure, and mixolydian mode. Vivid numbers for choirs reflected Petrauskas experience working with choirs. \n\n## History\n\n \n\n## First performance\n\n The plot is based on the medieval legend which became popular among Lithuanians after (1789\u20131831) wrote a song inspired by the legend. There was also a play about K\u0119stutis by Adam Asnyk which was translated from Polish by Vincas Kudirka and performed by various Lithuanian societies. Gabrielius Landsbergis-\u017demkalnis modified the plot of Vali\u016bnas' song and wrote a play which is characterized as a melodrama. According to Liudas Gira, the play was written in 1900 soon after Landsbergis-\u017demkalnis was released from the prison in Liep\u0101ja. It was published in 1906. That summer Mikas Petrauskas composed music for the opera. It was first staged by the Kankl\u0117s of Vilnius Society on at the present-day Lithuanian National Philharmonic Society. Because Petrauskas was searched by the Tsarist police, his name was not advertised and the performers did not take any photographs. The original cast included: \n\n## Later performances\n\n \"Birut\u0117\" was staged again on 15 August 1909 in Vilnius to commemorate the 10th anniversary of \"America in the Bathhouse\", the first public performance of a Lithuanian play in Lithuania. It was directed by and organized by the Lithuanian Mutual Aid Society of Vilnius. In the Russian Empire, the opera was performed on 17 July 1910 in Marijampol\u0117 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald and in June 1911 in Riga. When Petrauskas immigrated to the United States, he staged \"Birut\u0117\" for Lithuanian Americans. The first performance was organized by the Birut\u0117 choir established by Petrauskas in 1908. It was held at the International Theatre in Chicago and an American symphony orchestra directed by Theodore Thomas was hired for the occasion. Later the opera was performed in Brooklyn, Boston, and other Lithuanian American communities. In independent Lithuania, \"Birut\u0117\" was staged on 15 August 1919 in Kaunas to commemorate the 20th anniversary of \"America in the Bathhouse\". On 16 February 1921 (Lithuania's independence day), the opera was staged by the National Opera (present-day Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre). It was the second opera produced by the theatre after \"La traviata\". Scenography was created by Adomas Varnas, Petras Kalpokas, and Paulius Galaun\u0117 while costumes were imported from abroad. However, \"Birut\u0117\" attracted little interest and was cancelled after four performances. The opera returned to Kaunas on 23 April 1925. This performance was organized by Petrauskas and his newly established troupe. He hoped that it would lead to a permanent employment and that he could remain in Lithuania. However, the troupe was not well received and Petrauskas returned to the United States. 50th and 70th anniversaries of \"Birut\u0117\" were commemorated in Lithuania and by Lithuanians in the United States. For the 50th anniversary, Lithuanian Americans broadcast the opera on the radio. In 2006, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of \"Birut\u0117\", the Lithuanian National Philharmonic Society staged the opera anew. The full score has not survived, but Petrauskas published the piano\u2013vocal score in 1928. Therefore, the score was written again by the composer Teisutis Maka\u010dinas. To provide a more Lithuanian sound, harp was replaced with the Lithuanian kankl\u0117s. This new version of \"Birut\u0117\" was performed in Vilnius in 2006, during the Pa\u017eaislis Music Festival in 2007, in Bir\u017eai in 2008. A CD with the performance was published in 2009. On 6 July 2013 (the Statehood Day), \"Birut\u0117\" was performed near Birut\u0117 Hill in Palanga (the location where the opera is set).", "Caleb Ness": "Caleb Joshua Ness (; born July 16, 1999) is an American politician.

It has sixteen exits called \"gates\", and includes a toll portion, between the Porte de Vaise (or the Porte de Rochecardon coming from the east) and the Porte de Saint-Clair (part including the large Caluire Tunnel). \n\n## History\n\n \n\n## Boulevard de Ceinture\n\n A circular boulevard project emerged in the 1920s to complete the previous east Lyon ring roads further out. It was the Chalumeau plan of 1924 which provided not only for a circular boulevard but also for the connection of the various routes into the city. The Departmental Council of Rh\u00f4ne took the project in hand in 1928, under the leadership of its president Laurent Bonnevay. The chosen route partly occupies the site of the former Croix-Luizet perimeter wall in Gerland, hence its name (large) beltway. Further north, it must also constitute a dike protecting Villeurbanne and Brotteaux from the floods of the Rh\u00f4ne (particularly serious in 1924 and until 1947), before reaching the corner of the Parc de la T\u00eate d'or. To the south, the boulevard must end towards Gerland, near the future port, for a length of 14 km. It is designed as an urban boulevard which must irrigate the city and connect its different districts. It must be 46 m wide, have two carriageways of 10.5 m each, a central reservation of 13 m, in grass and planted with trees, two cycle paths, and two 6 m sidewalks, also planted with trees. It must also have gigantic roundabouts, up to 150 m in diameter for the connections with the penetrating ones, the loops of the belt. Work began in 1931 with the aim of occupying the unemployed in the department, following the Great Depression. World War II slowed down the work.

It is one of the main squares of Heidelberg and one of the central nodes of the public transport system, along with Willy-Brandt-Platz in front of the train station. \n\n## History\n\n In 1392, city walls were extended out to the area of modern Bismarckplatz and the inhabitants of the village of Bergheim, which had previously stood there, were forced to move inside the new circuit of the walls. At the beginning of the 19th century, the city's botanical gardens were located to the south of the modern square (these are now the Stadtgarten, but were St Anna cemetery until 1845). From 1847 to 1874, there was a harbour in the area, which provided berths for the growing amount of river boat transport. Renting out the berths was an important source of income for the city. However, because of the expansion of railway transport from 1845 and because the harbour was badly designed (the access to the Neckar river was too narrow, meaning that the water in the harbour could not circulate properly and became putrid), the harbour was filled in in 1874 and a park erected on the site. The whole area was named Bismarckplatz on 3 November 1874, in honour of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck's 60th birthday. Over time, the Bismarckplatz developed into the most important transport node in the city. In 1961, the Horten shopping centre (now: Galeria Kaufhof) opened on the south side of the square. Many old buildings were demolished to make way for this structure, which dominates the area visually to this day. The facade was renovated in 1982. The shopping centre is closed for renovations until 31 January 2024. As part of mayor modernisation programme in late 1970s, the tram network was removed from the neighbouring Hauptstrasse, which became a pedestrian zone. The resulting changes led to Bismarckplatz's current layout, which included renovations to the facade of the Horten shopping centre and the installation of a fountain sculpture by the couple Matschinsky-Denninghoff (popularly known as the \"Spaghettis\u00e4ule\", \"spaghetti columns\"), in 1985.

Her book \"The Piano-forte: its History Traced to the Great Exhibition of 1851\" became the standard work on the subject. \n\n## Life\n\n Rosamond Evelyn Mary Harding was born in Doddington, Cambridgeshire, the first child of Ambrose and Adela Harding (n\u00e9e Ethel Adela Hirst). The family were wealthy and lived comfortably. When Rosamund was one, the family moved to Histon Manor, north of Cambridge. She was educated at boarding schools and at home, where her father also taught her skills in drawing and illustration. During the First World War, Harding worked at a Chivers and Sons jam factory, and in 1922 began studying music at Newnham College, Cambridge. Disappointed with her grades, she dropped out after her first year. In 1927, Harding's father inherited Madingley Hall, which became the family home. There, Harding began research for a PhD, under the tutelage of Edward Joseph Dent. Her completed thesis was titled \"The Piano-forte - its history traced to the Great Industrial Exhibition, 1851\". This was subsequently published, but sold a disappointing 93 copies in its first four years. Harding also published the first modern edition of Ludovico Giustini's 1732 work \"Twelve Sonatas for Pianoforte\", the oldest music published specifically for the pianoforte. During the Second World War, in spite of being a qualified pilot, Harding - like many other women - was rejected for wartime service. Instead, she volunteered as an Air Raid Warden. Both of Harding's parents died in 1942, during which year she held a research fellowship at Newnham College, and was appointed its Director of Studies in Music. In 1948, the trustees of Madingley Hall sold it to the University of Cambridge, requiring Harding to move. Rosamond Harding died in Southwold, Suffolk on 6 May 1982. She is buried in St Mary Magdalene Churchyard, Madingley. \n\n## Works\n\n Of \"The Piano-forte: its History Traced to the Great Exhibition of 1851,\" Michael Cole wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Anyone who reads Rosamond Harding's history of the pianoforte must be profoundly impressed. Her readiness to explore and report the often bewildering byways of early piano actions; the precision of her technical drawings (which she laboriously executed herself in pen and ink); and the copious appendices with their heavy burden of reference data - such features tell us very quickly that we are engaging with an author with serious aims and high intellectual attainments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Cole notes that the book remained \"unquestionably the standard work on technical development of the pianoforte for at least half a century\", and \"is still recommended reading for anyone embarking on a piano technician's course... [remaining] a familiar reference work for curators and collectors of old keyboard instruments\". Although sales of her history of the pianoforte were disappointing during her lifetime, Harding's \"An Anatomy of Inspiration\" proved very popular, running through multiple editions. Cole calls it \"in many ways her most readable and thought provoking book\". According to Maria Popova, in this book Harding set out \"to reverse-engineer the mechanisms of creativity through the direct experiences of famous creators across art, science, and literature\". Popova writes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;One particularly interesting notion Harding puts forth is that of \u201cfringe-ideas\u201d \u2014 ideas on the periphery of the thinker\u2019s particular inquiry, but resonant in tone and thus able to enhance and flow into the creative process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;She called Harding's book \"an invaluable lens on the nooks and crannies of the creative process.\" On her death, \"The Times\" wrote of Harding that \"her substantial and pioneering contribution to the detailed study of the rise of the pianoforte... remains her monument\".", "Sama (surname)": "Sama is the surname of:", "Rimba Star FC": "Rimba Star Football Club is a football club in Brunei, playing in the Brunei Super League.

The site lies on a peninsula looking over the Gare Loch to Helensburgh. \n\n## Rosneath Castle\n\n A castle had stood on the site since at least the 12th century. It was built on a rock outcrop overlooking Castle Bay. The building was attacked by William Wallace while under English control. In 1490 the castle was gifted by King James IV to Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll. Through him it eventually passed to John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll who died in 1743. His widow decided to vacate the building. When his brother, Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll, visited the property in 1744 he found it an empty shell and decided to rescue the structure. He commissioned William Adam to draw up plans, but due to the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745 plans were put on hold and not until 1757 was the castle ready for reoccupation. In the 1780s the castle was remodelled in the French fashion on its interior with designs by Robert Mylne. By 1800 it was in the hands of John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll. On 30 May 1802, while the Duke was absent visiting Ardincaple Castle, the castle was destroyed in a fire. \n\n## Rosneath House\n\n The Duke decided to rebuild the property further inland than the original castle, on a flatter plateau, enabling a far larger and more formal mansion, as was the fashion of the day. The Duke returned to Robert Mylne but died in 1806 before any plans were realised. His heir, the Marquess of Lorne, chose to employ his own architects to continue the project, and used Alexander Nasmyth in conjunction with Joseph Bonomi the Elder, which was further complicated by the death of Bonomi in 1808. Bonomi before his death added an optimistic plaque, describing the project as the \"Lornian Palace\". For this reason and reasons of expense, the envisaged house was never fully realised. Work was halted in 1810 and the interiors of those sections completed was not in place until 1820. It was of unusual plan form, with a wide central corridor along his whole width. The broad plan was two storeys in height with a projecting colonnade on its north side. The main feature on the south side was a central circular tower of four storeys. It had a subterranean street leading to a service courtyard. In 1871 the then Marquess of Lorne married Queen Victoria's fourth daughter, Louise, thereafter known as Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll and the house was then treated more as a palace. On her husband's death in 1914 Rosneath became her Dower House. During the First World War she allowed the surplus rooms to be used by convalescing officers. The princess lived until 1939 but was childless. Her death precipitated the sale of the contents by auction in 1940. The house's strategic location brought a temporary reprieve and the building was occupied by military forces as a command centre, and was the location of the important meeting between Churchill, Eisenhower and Montgomery to negotiate Operation Torch: the invasion of North Africa. After the war its scenic location brought about its use as a caravan park but the house itself was left to decay, and worries of children playing in the derelict structure caused its demolition in 1961.

The idea comes to Alois Ruf Jr. to use these parts by making them directly adaptable to their turbo system, all installed in the chassis of the 964, which gave birth to the Ruf RCT. It offered performance similar to its predecessor the BTR for a price reduced by half. It would later give birth to a more powerful version while maintaining this state of mind, the RCT EVO. \n\n## RCT EVO\n\n The RCT EVO takes up the philosophy and codes of the original RCT and it was available in narrow, wide, coup\u00e9, convertible, targa, rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive versions.

He served as a city councilman of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania from 1996 until 2013 and was the city's 11th Mayor from 2013 to 2021. He currently is serving as deputy director of Human Resources for Northampton County. \n\n## Early life\n\n Donchez is a lifelong native of Southside Bethlehem. His father was a police officer who died of a heart attack when he was 18. He abandoned his dream of being a lawyer and pursued a teaching degree at Kutztown University in order to support his family. \n\n## Career\n\n \n\n## Educator\n\n Donchez worked as a social studies teacher at Allen Highschool for 35 years. \n\n## Bethlehem City Council\n\n Donchez got involved in politics by assisting then councilmen Paul Marcincin as his treasurer during the 1976 mayoral race. Marcincin, and his campaign staff, convinced Donchez to run for city council as a Democrat in 1995. Using his background as a teacher he sought to redevelop the decaying Bethlehem Steel plant as well as expanding and funding for the police. He also spearheaded a policy of severing connections between the local government and construction contracts, increasing financial accountability. Throughout his career as a councilmen he was notorious for keeping his political views close to his chest. \n\n## Mayor of Bethlehem\n\n Donchez, 62 years old at the time, decided to run for mayor as the incumbent mayor John B. Callahan had reached his term limits. He centered his primary campaign around his \"maturity\" compared to his Democratic opponent, J. William Reynolds, who was 30. Despite raising $112,000, 6 times more than Reynolds, he won the Democratic primary by a slim margin of 51.8 percent to 48.2 percent, or 184 individual votes. The Republican Party failed to file a candidate besides an unsuccessful, marginal, write-in campaign, meaning the primary was treated as the election proper. As mayor he modeled his mayorship around the technocratic mayorship of his mentor Marcincin, hiring professionals in various fields, and delegating to them committees on these fields. A large component of his mayorship would be his fiscal responsibility plan, a resumption of his work in the city council. The plan sought to streamline the city's budget, and cut unnecessary expenses, saving the city approximately $100,000 annually. He ran for a second term in 2017, and faced no opposition from the Democratic Party. He based his second term in office around taxation, vowing to not increase taxes in Bethlehem. In order to do so he slashed roughly $400,000 from the city's budget and drastically reduced the number of city employees. However, he did have to increase the budget to reform the Bethlehem area 9-1-1 dispatch center, turning it into a regional dispatch hub.

While Dayoung draws them off Annie heads to the lab, where she is furious to find Sharma rebuilding the Q-Engine. However Ryder persuades them this might be the only way to undo the damage caused by the future Quintum Mechanics. Dayoung is able to disable both of the troops in the subway but crashes out in Grand Central Station - where the appreciative crowd smuggles her away from Ciccione. Dunn, an NYPD officer sent to investigate the chaos in the subway, is stunned a surviving enforcer is his future self. Annie meanwhile overloads the Q-Engine and is fired by Sharma and arrested by Ciccione. Dayoung rescues her en route to the police station, and both face an uncertain future. Parallel to this in 2013 Gomez and Dayoung's partner Leshawn O'Patrick investigate the mysterious board of Quintum Mechanics. Among the corporation's innovations was replacing the NYPD with the NYTPD. The board have just completed reverse engineering the Q-Engine - which they plan to sent back in time to their 1986 incarnation, creating a paradox that will ensure their position. Gomez meanwhile attempts to raid Quintum Mechanics with the full NYTPD. The board responds by withdrawing the force's charter and a struggle breaks out before the city is plunged into a blackout by the board. \n\n## Vol 02: Only the Good\n\n Dayoung and Annie continue to lay low in 1986, though the former still slips away to discreetly fight crime. Deciding the city needs Rocket Girl she decides to suit up, only to find her gear is missing. Annie has taken it to Quintum Mechanics where Sharma is again trying to rebuild the Q-Engine. Ciccione has staked out the lab and moves in to arrest them but Dayoung is able to escape in her suit. She then saves Donald Trump and Ed Koch from a hostage situation at Radio City and a hold-up at an arcade, each time evading Ciccione. Dayoung is also being tracked by Dunn, who has salvaged weaponry from the Quintum vehicles along with his partner Phil Tweed. Ciccione attempts to bust them but gets shot, and passes on the information to Dayoung before he dies. She recruits Annie, Ryder and their colleagues Gene and Chaz to help them destroy all the data held at Quintum. Dunn and Tweed close in on the group and Dayoung sets off to meet them. Tweed is injured and tells her of the plan both Dunns have made - to take the technology from Quintum before it is destroyed. Dayoung arrives in time to save her friends, leaving Dunn catatonic. Despite the failure of another attempt to end Quintum, Dayoung is unbowed.  In 2013 Gomez meanwhile locates Dayoung's dismissed previous partner, Natasha Tallchief, who agrees to help the NYTPD take on Quintum. When they get inside they find that the leak was the board's virtual assistant Joshua, Dayoung's journey into the past being part of Quintum's plan. Both the NYTPD and Dayoung realise that the board are future versions of Annie, Ryder, Gene and Chaz, corrupted by the power the Q-Engine technology has given them. The 2013 Annie claims they are stuck in a cycle and sending back Dayoung was necessary to ensure the future of New York. In 1986 Dayoung is shot by the future Dunn, and Annie kills him in turn. Dayoung's death and final words are enough to convince Annie to finally destroy the Q-Engine, ending the cycle. \n\n## Reception\n\n Jamie Wilson rated the first issue 7/10 in a review for Big Comic Page, praising the art and moderately criticising the pace.  Reviewing the first volume for World Comic Book Review, Tom Kelly gave the series a negative review, criticising the characters and the internal consistency of the storyline while NPR's Etelka Lehoczky was another to praise Reeder's art, noting \"DaYoung is strong and graceful without any pneumatic body parts thrusting off the page.\" Ahead of the second trade's publication, Villain Media praised Amy Reeder's \"eyecatching\" art. In 2015 Digital Spy listed Dayoung Johansson as one of the 9 female comic characters they wanted to see in a movie, describing the series as \"pure, brazen and wonderfully realised B movie fare presented with skill and flair.\" CBR listed the title as one of the 10 Image Comics properties best suited to adaptation in 2022 \n\n## Collected editions\n\n The series has been collected in two in trade paperbacks by Image Comics.", "Rhysida polyacantha": "Rhysida polyacantha is a species of centipede in the Scolopendridae family. It is endemic to Australia, and was first described in 1985 by L. E. Koch. \n\n## Distribution\n\n The species occurs in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia. \n\n## Behaviour\n\n The centipedes are solitary terrestrial predators that inhabit plant litter, soil and rotting wood.", "Richard Vennar": "Richard Vennar (or Richard Vennard; 1564\u20131615) was an English writer, known particularly for his attempt to stage his play \"England's Joy\". \n\n## Life\n\n Vennar, baptised on 25 January 1564 at the Church of St Edmund, Salisbury, was the second son of John Vennard of Salisbury, a merchant. He was educated by , prebendary and succentor of Salisbury Cathedral, proceeding about 1572 to Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied for two years as a fellow commoner. Along with an Italian guide, a serving man and a page, provided by his father, he crossed to France towards the close of 1574, visited the court of Henri III, and procured letters of commendation to the emperor, Maximilian II. After some stay in Germany he returned home, and became a member of Barnard's Inn. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 10 June 1581, receiving the privileges of a special admission on 25 July 1587 (Records of Lincoln's Inn, 1896, i. 93). After the deaths of his elder brother in 1588 and his father in 1589, he found himself involved in a lawsuit with the husband \u2013 a lawyer, Richard Low \u2013 of his elder brother's widow for the possession of his patrimonial estates, and was ultimately compelled to take a younger brother's portion. Vennar went to prison at least twice during the affair, for allegedly stealing documents and for debt; he thought his reputation had been destroyed, and was determined to rehabilitate himself. In 1600 he proceeded to Scotland, and injudiciously solicited the intervention of James VI with the lords of the council. He had a favourable reception, and composed a thanksgiving for the delivery of James from the Gowrie conspiracy, which was presented to the king. His good reception aroused Queen Elizabeth's anger, and on his return to England he was promptly arrested and imprisoned for a short time \"as a dangerous member to the state\". \n\n## \"The Right Way to Heaven\"\n\n In 1601 appeared \"The Right Way to Heaven: and the true testimonie of a faithfull and loyall subject. Compiled by Richard Vennard of Lincolnes Inne. Printed by Thomas Este\" (published in London), a work of a religious character, but abounding in adulation of Queen Elizabeth. The first part was reprinted in the following year with several alterations and additions, with the title \"The Right Way to Heauen, and a good presedent for Lawyers and all other good Christians\". It was reprinted in John Nichols's \"Progresses of Queen Elizabeth\" (iii. 532\u201343). An undated reprint of the second part, \"The True Testimonie\", was preserved in the Bridgewater Library. It is prefaced by a dedication to James I, and contains a thanksgiving for the deliverance of the kingdom from the Gunpowder Plot. \n\n## \"England's Joy\"\n\n Not realising much by the sale, Vennar, who had in contemplation a second journey to Scotland, proclaimed his intention of representing England's triumphs over Spain in a masque entitled \"Englands Ioy\". The broadside of the plot is in possession of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and has been reprinted in their \"Miscellanies\" (x. 196). He announced in the broadside that it would be represented at the Swan on 6 November 1602, and a large company, including many noblemen, assembled to witness it. After taking the entrance money, however, Vennar disappeared, and the audience revenged themselves by breaking up the furniture. Vennar himself states that he was arrested by bailiffs when the masque was about to begin, but John Chamberlain relates that he fled on horseback, was pursued, captured, and brought before Sir John Popham, who treated the affair as a jest, and bound him over in five pounds to appear at the sessions (Chamberlain, Letters, Camden Soc. p. 163; Hazlitt, Shakespeare Jest Books, 1864, i. 145). The play was eventually staged by William Fennor in 1615. The episode caused much amusement. Vennar was universally regarded as an impostor and dubbed \"England's Joy\", a name which gave him peculiar annoyance. In 1614 he wrote a vehement protest, entitled \"An Apology: written by Richard Vennar of Lincolnes Inne, abusively called Englands Joy. To represse the contagious ruptures of the infected multitude\". It was printed in London by Nicholas Okes. The work is divided into two parts, of which the first is autobiographical, and the second relates Vennar's exertions to obtain the abolition of imprisonment for debt in England. The only perfect copy extant is in the British Museum Library, but it was reprinted in Collier's \"Illustrations of Old English Literature\" (vol. iii.). Collier inaccurately claims that it is the \"oldest piece of prose autobiography\" in English. Several allusions to \"England's Joy\" occur in contemporary literature, particularly in Ben Jonson's \"Love Restored\" (1610\u201311), in his \"The Masque of Augurs\" (1622), and in Sir John Suckling's comedy \"The Goblins\" (1646). A poem entitled \"Englands Joy\", commemorating the defeat of the Irish clans in 1600 under Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, by R. V., published without date, place, or printer's name, is sometimes attributed to Vennar, but may quite as well be the work of Richard Rowlands. \n\n## Last years\n\n In 1606 Vennar was arrested on suspicion of an intention to defraud Sir John Spencer of \u00a3500 on pretence of preparing a masque under the patronage of Sir John Watts, the Lord Mayor. After that he avoided London, and lived chiefly in Essex and Kent. He was finally imprisoned for debt in 1614 in Wood Street Compter, where he wrote his \"Apology\", and died. William Fennor wrote that Vennar had objected to fees demanded in the compter and been thrown into the black hole, where \"lying without a bedde, hee caught such an extreame cold in his legges, that it was not long before he departed this life\". (Fennor, Compters Commonwealth, 1617, pp. 62\u201364). He was buried at St Michael's Church, Wood Street on 13 October 1615. \n\n## References\n\n Attribution", "Rest in Metal": "\"Rest in Metal\" is the fourth episode of the American murder mystery comedy-drama television series \"Poker Face\". The episode was written by Christine Boylan and directed by Tiffany Johnson. It was released on Peacock on January 26, 2023, alongside \"Dead Man's Hand\", \"The Night Shift\", and \"The Stall\". The series follows Charlie Cale, a woman with the ability to detect if people are lying. After using her ability to win poker tournaments, she is caught by a powerful casino owner in Laughlin. Rather than banning her from his casino, he gives her a job as a waitress. After her friend is found dead, Charlie uncovers a plot where the owner's son ordered her murder to protect a powerful client. She is now on the run after exposing the casino, with head of security Cliff going after her. The episode follows Charlie as a merch seller for a washed-up heavy metal band, Doxxxology. When the new drummer dies during a performance, Charlie finds that his death may not have been an accident. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who praised the writing, performances (particularly Lyonne, Sevigny, and Cirillo) and tension. \n\n## Plot\n\n Now an employee at big-box hardware store, Ruby Ruin (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), vocalist of the early-1990s one-hit wonder heavy metal band Doxxxology, recruits Gavin (Nicholas Cirillo) as a temporary drummer for a summer tour. She, guitarist Al (John Darnielle) and bassist Eskie (G.K. Umeh) attempt to write a song recapturing the success of their hit song \"Staplehead\", but are constantly frustrated by Gavin's incessant drumming and distractible personality. During a performance, Gavin is slapped by Ruby for stealing her scream note. Ruby apologizes later at their hotel; Gavin then performs a song he has drafted, \"Sucker Punch\", to the band members. Stunned by the song's \"hit\" quality and embittered that the royalties from \"Staplehead\" go to their previous drummer, the band conspires to steal the song from him, firing their roadie Deuteronomy (Chuck Cooper) and rigging Gavin's amplifier to electrocute him during the climactic scream of \"Staplehead\". They then rewrite and sign the lyrics and burn Gavin's original lyric sheet. A few days prior, Ruby hires Charlie (Natasha Lyonne) as the band's merch seller/roadie. She begins to bond with Gavin, noticing that he never wears shoes, has a camera pointed at his kick drum, and writes lyrics spontaneously based on his surroundings. After the stapler incident, she scolds Ruby for slapping Gavin, prompting her to apologize. The next day, she witnesses Gavin's death on stage after taking a Polaroid of the climactic moment. Charlie picks up on Ruby's lie when she says that the band \"got lucky\" to the coroner, who rules Gavin's death as an equipment malfunction. While the band records Gavin's song the next day at a studio in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Charlie meets a woman (Emily Yoshida) who hosts a true crime podcast named \"Murder Girl\". The band then arrives in Milwaukee, where they will open for a band named Krampus. While cleaning her car, Charlie realizes that the lyrics to \"Sucker Punch\" correspond to advertising slogans on items in Gavin's pockets. When questioned by Charlie, Ruby admits that Gavin wrote the song but insists that she needs a new hit in her career. Questioning Deuteronomy, Charlie learns that modern amps usually have three prongs as a safety measure. Finding Gavin's amp in the trailer, she notices that it has three prongs and an older, unsafe model was used on stage when Gavin was murdered. Charlie overhears Al practicing a new song titled \"You Can't Un-Murder Someone\". She voices her suspicion of Al to Ruby, who dismisses it. Finally, Charlie uses Gavin's footwork camera to confirm that the band wore thick-soled Doc Martens during the performance to avoid electrocution. She confronts the band about killing Gavin, but Ruby fires her. Charlie learns that a video of her punching Krampus's lead singer has gone viral. Cliff (Benjamin Bratt) suddenly appears and chases her; she escapes into the concert and succeeds in escaping. As \"Sucker Punch\" leads to renewed interest in Doxxxology, the members prepare to sign a recording contract. However, a recording executive reveals that the rhythm track to \"Sucker Punch\", which the band failed to modify from Gavin's original draft, is stolen from the theme song for the sitcom \"Benson\", resulting in a severe copyright infringement case. \"Murder Girl\", tipped off by Charlie, bases her next episode on Doxxxology's crimes. \n\n## Production\n\n \n\n## Development\n\n The series was announced in March 2021, with Rian Johnson serving as creator, writer, director and executive producer. Johnson stated that the series would delve into \"the type of fun, character driven, case-of-the-week mystery goodness I grew up watching.\" The episode was directed by Tiffany Johnson, while Christine Boylan wrote it. This was Johnson's first directing credit and Boylan's first writing credit. Boylan worked in making sure that every detail of the episode added to an impact of the story, saying \"My motto is 'use everything'. Use every piece of furniture around you. If there's a bottle of water, then what's interesting about that bottle? Use it somehow. And if it doesn't work, you can cut it out.\" \n\n## Casting\n\n The announcement of the series included that Natasha Lyonne would serve as the main lead actress. She was approached by Johnson about working on a procedural project together, with Lyonne as the lead character. As Johnson explained, the role was \"completely cut to measure for her.\" Benjamin Bratt also joined the series in the recurring role of Cliff, whose character chases Charlie after she ran away from the casino in the previous episode. Due to the series' procedural aspects, the episodes feature several guest stars. Johnson was inspired by the amount of actors who guest starred on \"Columbo\", wanting to deem each guest star as the star of the episode, which allowed them to attract many actors. The episode featured appearances by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Nicholas Cirillo, who were announced to guest star in June 2022. The episode also featured an appearance by John Darnielle, who also worked in writing the songs of the episode. \n\n## Critical reception\n\n \"Rest in Metal\" received extremely positive reviews from critics. Saloni Gajjar of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode an \"A\u2212\" grade and wrote, \"How often can Charlie find herself in a situation where a stranger she meets ends up six feet into the ground? But it's still early into the show, so I'm not complaining. The \"Columbo\"-esque gimmick is paying off richly. I'm thrilled there are six more episodes of Charlie finding herself in a mess she has to dig herself out of.\" Alan Sepinwall wrote, \"It's also the one of these four that most effectively uses the \"Knives Out\"/\"\" rewind gimmick, as seeing Charlie hanging out with the doomed drummer adds even more value to her desire to catch his killers than the glimpses of her friendship with Natalie do in \"Dead Man's Hand\". And the payoff to the drummer's seemingly random Benson love is, like the trash can bit in \"The Night Shift\", a great bit of sleight of hand. As the playwright Anton Chekhov once wrote, if you put a Robert Guillaume sitcom on the screen in act one...\" Amanda Whiting of \"Vulture\" gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"Of the initial episode drop, \"Rest in Metal\" is the first in which the crime feels genuinely 'getawaywithable' to me. Some of that might be because Ruby, thanks to Sevigny's steely interpretation of what it looks like to be a woman in despair, is the first killer we've met who really seems to have her whole heart in the game.\"", "Richard Sheldon": "Richard Sheldon may refer to:", "Robert Logan (bishop)": "Robert Logan (1784 - 22 April 1830) was the Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath, Ireland from 1827 to his death in 1830. \n\n## Early life and ministry\n\n Logan was born near Navan, County Meath in 1784, he was ordained a priest in the Diocese of Meath on 27 May 1809. \n\n## Episcopal Ministry\n\n Pope Leo XII named him Coadjutor bishop of Meath and titular bishop of Tremithus on 24 August 1824, he was consecrated on 28 October of that year.

Strong, 724 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2013), the First Circuit had to consider if the violation of federal regulations occurring on a federal property could still stand if such regulations had not met posting requirements. \n\n## Background\n\n On May 24, 2011, at around 11:30am Ronald Strong entered the Edward T. Gignoux Courthouse in Portland, Maine. As he was going through security Strong informed the court security officer that he needed to use the bathroom. While waiting Strong defecated in his pants at which point he was escorted to the restroom. Approximately ten minutes later Strong left the restroom and went to the clerk's office. Approximately fifteen minutes later a law enforcement officer approached the restroom to use it but was unable due to the condition of the restroom. The officer reported to court security that someone had severally soiled the restroom and a cleaning person was summoned. The entire restroom was unusable with witnesses recalling that 75% of the floor was covered in feces, multiple spots on the walls were also covered including streaks up to two feet in length, the paper towel and toilet paper dispensers were smeared, and toilet seat. In the toilet bowl there were no feces, only urine. Witnesses reported that feces were smeared in spots and not splattered. The cleaning person had fourteen years of experience at the courthouse and training in the cleaning of bodily substances, they reported that they were unsure of where to even begin with cleaning such a mess. After the cleaning was completed the cleaning person's clothing has to be discarded in a biohazard bag. On May 27, 2011, Strong was charged with three misdemeanors, willfully damaging federal property, creating a hazard on federal property, and creating a nuisance on federal property. At trial Strong argued that the court was out of compliance with posting regulations which was a requirement to charge him. Additionally Strong argued the government had failed to show his intent at the time. He was sentenced to seven days in jail. \n\n## Opinion of the court\n\n The First Circuit affirmed the decision of the lower court. In the review of the statute requiring the posting of the regulations Judge Lynch highlighted that the law stated that the posting of regulations had to be located \"in a conspicuous place on the property.\" and nowhere did it say it had to be in the front of the courthouse. On the matter of intent, the lower court noted that \"The defendant may very well have accidentally put some on the floor or on the walls as he tried to clean up, but it was smeared over 75 percent of the floor, on two walls at several different locations, and that indicates to me that in fact, it was a willful act.\".

The pagoda foundation stones with pillar holes and reliquary holes are separated by about 27.4 meters. During a four-year archaeological excavation from 1997 revealed that the South Pagoda and Kondo Hall are lined up north to south, the Lecture Hall to the north of them is slightly shifted to the west, and the East Pagoda is located on the east side of the Kondo Hall. The Kondo was a 5 x 4 bay structure measuring 14.8 x 12.4 meters. The Lecture Hall was also 5 x 4 bays, but slightly larger at 16.0 x 13.6 meters. The East Pagoda had a base 8.4 meters square and the West Pagoda had a base 10 meters square, indicating that the pagodas may not have been identical in height.

", "Tolotang": "Tolotang (sometimes written Tolottang, or Towani Tolotang) is the original religion of Bugis which is adhered to by the majority in several areas within the province of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, especially in Sidenreng Rappang Regency or commonly known as Sidrap Regency. About 5,000 residents in the Amparita area, Sidrap Regency adhere to a religion that has been passed down from generation to generation. Because the Indonesian government only recognizes six religions, the rest are categorized as belief in God Almighty, and Tolotang adherents do not want to be called a religious sect finally they joined themselves with Hinduism. Therefore, until now this belief is also known as the \"Hindu Tolotang\". It is the same with the Kaharingan religion of the Dayak tribe and Aluk Todolo of the Toraja people who also joined Hinduism, so they are known as \"Kaharingan Hindus\" and \"Alukta Hindus\". \n\n## History\n\n Some sources say that the founder of Tolotang is La Panaungi. These Tolotang adherents know that God exists and they know him better by the name of \"Dewata Seuwa'e\" (God Almighty) who has the title \"Patoto'e\" (The One Who Determines Destiny). So Tolotang is classified as not animism or dynamism as often touted by the Bugis themselves who already believe in other religions, and are no longer members of the Tolotang community. The Tolotang religion is a religion that has known God since before the arrival of the Samawi religions in the region. In its development, Islam became the majority religion in almost the entire area of South Sulawesi so native religions such as Tolotang also began to decline known although some still maintain this ancestral religion in a community group. Another problem arose in 1966, namely when the government did not recognize the religions embraced by the aforementioned community groups. At that time the government only recognized five religions, namely Islam, Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, and Buddhist. The government then gave Tolotang residents three choices. Administratively, will they be categorized as Muslim, Christian, or Hindu, because according to the government the three religions are close to the Tolotang beliefs. Based on the results of the agreement, Hindus were chosen. Since then, this community has officially embraced Hinduism. However, in practice, they still carry out their customs and embrace the beliefs that they have inherited from generation to generation. In the past, followers of the local Bugis religion also suffered a tragic fate. They were being chased by Darul Islam/Indonesian Islamic Army (DI/TII) rebels led by Kahar Muzakkar. The rebels forced many of Tolotang's predecessors to renounce their faith. Not a few of them were killed.", "Turris altispira": "Turris altispira is an extinct species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Turridae, the turrids. C.

This includes negotiating peace with illegal armed groups, but also putting the community at the center of these negotiations, since they are the ones in the middle of the confrontation. The law passed in October allows Petro to initiate a peace process with all armed actors and put an end to a decades-long armed conflict that has left almost half a million dead and millions displaced. The law grants powers to negotiate with armed groups such as the ELN, and the FARC dissidents that rejected a 2016 agreement and returned to the armed struggle and another that never signed the pact. It can also initiate peace negotiations with criminal gangs such as the Clan del Golfo, whose leaders and members may receive benefits such as reduced sentences and non-extradition in exchange for reporting routes to export cocaine and handing over part of the illegally obtained fortunes. Total Peace also contemplates the creation of a peace fund to guarantee social investment in remote areas hit by violence and the presence of illegal armed groups. \n\n## Approval\n\n The project was evaluated in advance by members of the two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives, where it was subsequently approved as Law 181 or the Total Peace Law, with 62 votes in favor and 13 against in the Senate and 128 votes in favor and seven against in the House of Representatives. Communities welcomed all the efforts towards complete peace and pointed out that the initiative is strengthened with the comprehensive implementation of the Peace Agreement and that together with the project to bring criminal organizations to justice, they will be a substantial contribution to the materialization of complete peace. According to the political group, the peace agenda promoted by the Colombian president cuts across all the objectives of his government program, considering that structural changes require the end of all armed conflicts in the country. In this sense, Comunes called on all armed groups to dialogue or submit to justice to achieve that goal. \n\n## Support and opposition\n\n The international community has welcomed Petro's intention to re-establish the peace agreements ignored by the previous administration; the United Nations will support the implementation with millions of resources provided by the Multidonor Fund. Mireia Villar Forner, resident coordinator of the United Nations system in Colombia and co-president of the Fund, assured the press that, in an innovative way, the Fund intends to support broader actions to build peace in Colombia beyond the implementation of the peace agreement signed in 2016 between the State and the guerrilla of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Multidonor Fund received new contributions for 2023 that add up to 17.4 million dollars from Norway, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom and that complement others already made by countries such as Switzerland, Canada and Spain. Thus, the action plan approved for next year will have an investment of 55 million dollars, the highest since the fund was created in 2016 to support the peace process with the FARC. However, the amount that will be invested in the \"total peace\" policy of the current government was not detailed.

The current situation of Spanish in Trinidad and Tobago is complex due to the recent influx of Venezuelan migrants and a misguided popular belief that there was never a hispanophone presence on the island, resulting in all Spanish speakers are labeled as Venezuelan or \"Spanish\". Most native Spanish speakers in Trinidad were historically found in the Santa Cruz, Caura Valley, Paramin, Lopinot and other rural communities working in and around the cocoa industry. The local dialect of Trinidadian Spanish is almost completely lost due to its social status (as a language for the poor or migrants), the prestige of English under British rule and larger influxes of non-Hispanic communities: East Indians, Chinese, Portuguese, Syrians, etc. The last vestiges of Hispano-Trinidadian culture can be seen in the Christmas period. Traditional music from the Northern Range, Parang a \"galicismo\" of Parranda, uses the Joropo, Gaita and Polo music styles among others and is sung in Spanish. More recent Soca Parang and Chutney Parang have been performed in English. Pastelles, or pasteles in Spanish, are also eaten. Trinidadian Spanish is closely related to the Spanish found in the east of Venezuela (Sucre, Caribbean Coast) and Margarita Island and shares many features with Caribbean Spanish in general. Due to the Venezuelan presence in Trinidad, it is likely that the local dialect of spoken Spanish will become ever more \"venezolano\" or \"sucrense\". \n\n## History\n\n The Spanish claimed Trinidad in 1498 and settled on the island in 1560. Spanish speakers on the island have been present in some form ever since. European settlers were small in number but the indigenous people were taught and proselytized in Spanish. After the C\u00e9dula de Poblaci\u00f3n, French Creole took over as \"lingua franca\" among the newly arrived peoples, then replaced by English after 1797 when Britain officially took the island. The second wave of Spanish speakers came in the form of \"peons\", eastern Venezuelan agricultural workers who arrived in the early 19th century. Due to their low economic and social status, Spanish was stigmatized as a language of the \"Panyols\" so was quickly dropped by many descendants or not taught at all for fear of passing on \"bad English\". Due to socioeconomic factors and geographic isolation, Spanish, the local variety especially, was not adopted or even heard by large parts of the population. Except from these two larger migrations, throughout Trinidad's history, there have been movements of people in smaller numbers between Venezuela (and to a lesser extent other Spanish Speaking countries) and Trinidad. These include the \"'bozal\" ' Spanish speaking Slaves from Spanish America, descendants of Trinidadians who migrated from El Callao and G\u00fciria and migrants from Maracaibo for the petroleum and cocoa industry.

The facility was a temporary, open-air ice rink that was subject to weather conditions and could only be used for part of the year. \n\n## History\n\n In 1924, football coach Hank Swasey announced the formation of an ice hockey team for UNH that would begin play that year. That team played just 4 games but, without a home venue, were forced to travel for each match. The following year, plans for an on-campus rink were finalized and the UNH Ice Rink was erected behind New Hampshire Hall on Main street. The Wildcats were able to use their rink more often than most due to their typically cold winters, however, they were affected by adverse weather conditions like snow and rain that could render the ice surface unusable. In order to protect the rink, it was moved to Lewis Field on the opposite side of Main street in 1939 to help protect it from inclement weather. Despite these issues, the ice hockey team continued to call the Rink home for nearly 30 years. It wasn't until a series of warm winter in the late 1940s that plans were put in place for a more suitable home for the program. In the mid-50s, alumnus Harry C. Batchelder donated equipment to build the first artificial rink for the program.

He was named after his grand-grandfather Ughurlu Khan (d. 1738), who served as beylerbey of Karabakh in 1702\u20131738. \n\n## Life\n\n As he was the eldest son of Javad, he was demanded as hostage by Pavel Tsitsianov in 1803. He managed to flee Ganja together his brother Ali Qoli during Russian siege of the city in 1804 and take a refuge with Shirin beg of Samukh. Tsitsianov asked them to appear before him in Tiflis in 1804 and promised safety. However Ughurlu chose to escape via Shirvan Khanate and join Qajar crown prince Abbas Mirza instead. \n\n## Russo-Persian war of 1804-1813\n\n He commanded a part of Qajar army during Russo-Persian war of 1804-1813. He camped on the shores of Tartar river in 1806 and sent messages to local Muslims to rise up against Russians when Abbas Mirza captured Askeran Fortress. According to archival records, he also promised safety to Christians of Ganja. Although he petitioned the Russian government with permission to return to Ganja in 1807, alongside 779 members of nobility this petition was left without answer. He wrote another letter to Kazakh mouravi Joseph Bebutov (father of Vasili Bebutov) on 11 September 1808, informing him of recent Franco-Persian alliance and Askar Khan Afshar's appointment as ambassador, threatening with an exaggerated possible French attack against Russia. He was left behind with 12000 men near Khachbulag when Abbas Mirza's army crossed Dilijan for unsuccessful attack at Ganja in 1809. He forced some tribesmen from Ayrum tribe to resettle in Nakhchivan in 1810, when Abbas Mirza tried to invade Karabakh but was defeated at Meghri on the Aras River. Later in 1811, he was approached by Alexander Tormasov, Russia viceroy of Georgia who promised him full immunity and stipend, should he decide to submit to Russia. After fruitless talks, new viceroy in Georgia, Filippo Paulucci sent Ughurlu Khan's mother and daughter to him in 1812 instead, citing waste of economic resources. \n\n## Russo-Persian war of 1826\u20131828\n\n He returned to Caucasus again in the army of Abbas Mirza in 1826. On July 16, 1826, troops under the command of Abbas Mirza attacked the camp of Russian troops near Shirak. While khan of Erivan, Hossein Qoli advanced in the direction of Ganja to occupy it, Abbas Mirza surrounded the fortress of Shusha, which by that time was in the hands of the Russians. Ganja was easily occupied as new viceroy Yermolov ordered retreat. Ughurlu who entered the city accompanying prince Mohammad, was declared as new Khan of Ganja by the decree of Abbas Mirza on 26 July. But the capture of Shusha was delayed which made it possible for the Russian troops to gather strength and attack Qajar amy. Abbas Mirza was forced to leave the siege of Shusha and attack the Russian troops near Shamkhor, where he was defeated. Ughurlu khan was among the prisoners of war but was released later. On September 13, the troops met again on the Guru Gobu plain near the tomb of the poet Nizami. A part of the right wing of the Iranian army was commanded by Ugurlu Khan. However, battle was a disaster for Iranian side.

She looks to develop more sophisticated prediction models for breast cancer diagnoses that helps women better understand their risk. She created a breast cancer biomarker discovery program that demonstrated the association between hormones, lifestyle factors, and cancer risk. Her research demonstrated that women who used hormone replacement therapy were more likely to suffer from breast cancer than women who did not, and that the risk was highest amongst women who used a progestin\u2013oestrogen combination therapy. The increased risk associated with hormone replacement therapy depended on body mass index; women with a body mass index below 25 were most at risk. From 2006 to 2010, Hankinson was Principal Investigator of the Nurses' Health Study, where, in a trial of over 200,000 people, she investigated how lifestyle (dietary intake, obesity) and hormones impact cancer risk. Her research showed that people who work night shifts experience a greater cancer risk. She joined the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2011.

His father was the priest to the house of lawyer and jurist Sir V. Bhashyam Aiyangar, the first Indian Advocate-General of Madras. Varadachariar started as an apprentice under Aiyangar and later under P. S. Sivaswami Iyer. He was admitted into the bar in 1905 and rose to become the judge of the Madras High Court in 1934.  Varadachariar was knighted and appointed as a judge of the Federal Court of India, the forerunner to the Supreme Court of India, in 1939.

Murray, never really anybody's sideman, takes the reins and turns his rhythmic chops on in such a way that the pianist cannot help but to respond in a like manner... when it's over, in the silence, the listener will most assuredly sit for a while in disbelief at what just transpired.\" The authors of \"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings\" awarded the album a full 4 stars, calling it \"an intriguing collaboration, in which both men hang up their 'free music' armour and get down to what sounds like a set of phantom standards.\" Author Todd S. Jenkins called the recording session a \"dream opportunity\" with \"appealing\" results, and commented: \"Murray's deliberate tuning of his drums plays a vital role in settings like this, permitting him to function as melodically as Schlippenbach's forceful piano approach casts him in a [Cecil] Tayloresque percussive role.\" The authors of \"Jazz: The Rough Guide\" remarked: \"After the furor of 1960s free jazz, we now have \"Smoke\" drifting over the scene. Schlippenbach and Murray have mellowed and there is a beguiling thoughtfulness and lyricism in this music.\"", "St. Aidan's Anglican Church (Spokane, Washington)": "St. Aidan's Anglican Church is a historic church building in the East Central neighborhood of Spokane, Washington. Built in 1909 as the First German Baptist Church, the building has changed hands several times and is currently a parish of the Diocese of Cascadia in the Anglican Church in North America. \n\n## History of the building\n\n The First German Baptist Church was founded by the Rev. F. J. Reichle, who arrived in Spokane in 1904 as a missionary of the General Conference of German Baptist Churches in North America. He organized the church in 1906 and became its first minister. The next year, the congregation acquired a lot at Hartson Avenue and Arthur Street and built a wooden church there in 1909. (Reichle left the church in 1911 under controversy after \"romantic developments\" with a maid 17 years his junior. The pair married a year later in Oregon.) An addition to the front of the church was completed in the 1920s. The church continued to offer services in both English and German until the 1940s, during which decade the church was renamed Arthur Street Baptist Church, a member of the North American Baptist Conference that succeeded the German Baptist group. This congregation renamed itself after 1953 and moved to a new location. The original building at Hartson and Arthur became the home of St. Matthew's Baptist Church, a prominent African-American church in Spokane. The church was used as a meeting location for the civil rights movement in Spokane, and the local NAACP chapter frequently met at the church from the 1950s onward. By 2006, however, St. Matthew's congregation had dwindled and the building had fallen into disrepair. St. Matthew's relocated to a vacant but newer church building. After several years of vacancy, the building was sold to the Anglican Diocese of Cascadia to be used for a church plant called St. Aidan's Anglican Church. The church planter and his wife are restoring the building while the church uses it for worship. \n\n## Architecture\n\n The church was originally a two-story, cross-gabled structure with wood siding and a stone foundation. Its steeply pitched roofs and corner tower exemplified Carpenter Gothic architecture. Decorative trusswork originally filled in the gable ends but were removed in the 1928 addition. The removal of the trusswork left the building austere and relatively unornamented, except for details on bargeboards and decorative eave brackets. The 1928 addition resulted in a substantial change to the church's appearance, moving the main entrance to the eastern (Arthur Street) side and adding a tower with a pyramidal roof on the southeast corner.  The church's interior features an open foyer on the east side of the building and a sanctuary that occupies the rest of the floor. An immersion baptistry is located under removable floorboards behind the pulpit on the west wall of the church. A drop ceiling added later obscures the vaulting in the sanctuary.", "Svyatoslav Sokol": "Svyatoslav Mikhailovich Sokol (; 22 March 1946 \u2013 3 December 2022) was a Russian editor and politician.

The establishment of the Port of Los Angeles in the early 1900s spurred the development of the nearby city, and electric streetcars provided local transit services for workers and later military personnel. Pacific Electric was the primary operator in the city. \n\n## Interurbans\n\n California Pacific, a subsidiary of the Los Angeles Traction Company, began interurban service to San Pedro over a narrow-gauge line in 1903. Pacific Electric opened their competing San Pedro via Dominguez Line on May 21, 1905. Pacific Electric had additionally opened a line east to Long Beach, providing a connection between the two cities and allowing for trains to be run though on the Long Beach Line. All streetcar operations in San Pedro were consolidated under Pacific Electric in 1911. Several services offered a one-seat ride from San Pedro to downtown Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Balboa. The company ran special services to serve Catalina Island steamships. The last interurban service to San Pedro ran under the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority on December\u00a07,\u00a01958. \n\n## Streetcars\n\n \n\n## Point Firmin Local\n\n This line ran from the Pacific Electric depot at Sixth and Palos Verdes to Point Firmin via Sixth and Pacific. It was constructed between 1905 and 1906 as far south at Fourteenth Street and completed to Point Firmin in 1907. While it was the most popular route in San Pedro, competition from parallel bus operators tempered its ridership potential. Service ended in October 1934 and tracks were removed in the following years. \n\n## Outer Harbor Local\n\n Cars were probably routed through to the La Rambla Line at its inner terminus. The line was entirely rerouted in October 1916, taking it off of city streets and to the Outer Harbor via a private right of way. Company records indicate service ended on the line after April 21, 1924, and the final years of service were very informal. The line continued to see infrequent passenger service whenever the U.S. fleet was stationed at San Pedro, as interurban cars from Los Angeles would end their runs at the Harbor. This finally ended after September 1940. \n\n## La Rambla Local\n\n Opening in 1906, this was one of the three major streetcar routes in San Pedro. Cars ran from Fourth and Palos Verdes via Fourth, Front, Sixth, Pacific, Fifth, a private right-of-way, and Alameda to First. Tracks on Fourth, Front, and Fifth were abandoned around 1915 and was likely routed through to the Outer Harbor Line. In 1928, this line accounted for 38% of San Pedro's local passenger traffic with just over 20% of the system's route miles. The last car operated over the line on January 23, 1938. This was the final streetcar line to operate in San Pedro. \n\n## West Basin Line\n\n A minor line for local service, this line ran from San Pedro's Pacific Electric station via Front Street, a private right-of-way, another private right-of-way adjacent to Wilmington &amp; San Pedro Road, B Street, and a private right-of-way to Wilmington Station. By 1911, service had been reduced to a single round trip in the afternoons. Pacific Electric was granted permission to end service in November 1931, though the final years of this is not well documented. While local service was discontinued, tracks were maintained and were seeing regular use by 1942 as the bridge route over the harbor was deemed hazardous during wartime. \n\n## Fourteenth Street Line\n\n Originally an independent service, most cars had stopped running on Fourteenth Street by 1915, though it was still used as the ending of runs from the Outer Harbor Line.

It occurs in New Zealand, South America, Southern Africa, and is very common in wet forests of Australia and Tasmania. It has an erect brownish stalk with a flat frond structure; it closely resembles a different liverwort species, \"Hymenophyton flabellatum.\" It can be distinguished from \"H. flabellatum\" by the marginal teeth on its thalloid lobes, and the positions of its sex organs. This dendroid, thalloid liverwort is characterised by its palmate, 'fan-like' fronds which arise from its distinct brown stalk which is up to 2cm tall. The stalk arises from a rhizome, which utilises rhizoids to attach to soil substrate. Fronds are commonly flat and forked forming a triangular shape. The frond typically divides into two segments which can divide into two again. Forks may be scarce, or not occur at all, however this is rare. The frond can also occasionally be prostrate. Variability in thickness of the lamina can influence its appearance, it can be thin and translucent, or thick and opaque. The frond is generally &lt;1cm, with segments approximately 2mm wide. Segments of the frond have toothed margins, and can be reddish-brown (this can sometimes be true for the entire plant). \u00a0If an individual's margins are irregularly lobed or not well-developed, it can be mistaken for species of the genus \"Podomitrium.\" Male plants of this species are smaller and less branched, with small scales along the centre of the thallus covering antheridia, while female plants have one or two scales covering archegonia, and produce sporophytes which are encased in a white, fleshy tube. The sporophyte has a reddish shoot-calyptra, up to 1cm long; the capsule is &lt;5mm long with valves which can remain together at their tips after dehiscence. \n\n## Habitat and distribution\n\n Most commonly found in wet sclerophyll forest, but is also found in rainforest, fern gullies, and on occasion, dry sclerophyll forest. It can occur in drier habitats where conditions allow, in shady, moist areas such as banks of permanent streams. It is found in Southern African countries such as South Africa, and South American countries such as Argentina, and it is widespread in wet forests of New Zealand. It is a common plant in Tasmanian wet sclerophyll forest and rainforest, growing in many areas where it has adequate substrate. \n\n## Naming and species delineation\n\n The species is accepted as \"Symphyogyna hymenophyllum\" as well as \"Symphyogyna podophylla,\" these are frequently used synonymously, however it\u00a0is listed in the Tropicos botanical database as \"Symphyogyna podophylla.\" It was found that while the species are very similar in morphological habit, they are distinct, in terms of spore ornamentation and phytochemistry, and in morphological differences which can be seen when they are observed carefully in their habitats; \"S. podophylla\" has smaller fronds which fork less.These differences occur based on location; the New Zealand species of \"S. podophylla\" is distinct to the species of \"S. hymenophyllum\" found in Australia and South Africa. In phytochemical tests, Tasmanian, South African and Argentinian specimens had highly similar phenolic content, and similar spores; each was distinct to the New Zealand samples. This has led to the conclusion that New Zealand's \"S. podophylla\" is a different species to \"S. hymenophyllum.\"", "Syzygium johnsonii": "Syzygium johnsonii, known as the rose satinash, is a rainforest tree of tropical and subtropical Queensland, Australia.", "Stolephorus insularis": "The Hardenberg's anchovy, Stolephorus insularis, is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Engraulidae.

The album is counterbalanced by an amalgamation of subtle oddities that outline the ensemble's unmistakably detectable watermark that vaults the jazz genre into parts unknown.\" Writing for \"The Free Jazz Collective\", Matthew Grigg stated: \"Whether devotional rhythmic grooves, searching abstraction or full-throttle velocity, the interaction between the musicians is never less than adroitly judged, simultaneously casting a glancing eye backward whilst straining for the farthest reaches of the cosmos.\" The editors of \"The Quietus\" included the album in their \"Favoured Jazz Albums of 2014\" list, calling it \"a joy,\" and remarking: \"Mazurek conjures a hazy tropical atmosphere in which cosmic jazz, improv, funk and electronics dance freely.\" In an article for \"The New York City Jazz Record\", Alex Henderson wrote: \"Space is used extensively and the Chicago school of avant garde jazz is clearly an influence thanks, in part, to the input of Mazurek and Taylor\u2014while there are heated moments, the musicians build up to them instead of clobbering the listener from the get-go.\" David Whiteis of \"JazzTimes\" stated: \"The overall feel here is of remarkable coherence...

Arizona\", 16 Ariz. 269, 144 Pac. 640 (1914), was a landmark decision of the Arizona Supreme Court in which the court acknowledged the competency of Indigenous, female, and non-English speaking witnesses. \n\n## Background of the case\n\n In the state of Arizona, before 1914, the government did not recognize indigenous people as right-bearing individuals or citizens. Due to this, Native residents, especially those who did not speak English, were not allowed to testify in court against white defendants. In the late night of September 1st, 1913, a gun shot was heard by A.J. Oliver, a white resident living in Granite Creek, a primarily indigenous community located near Prescott, Arizona. The next morning, on September 2nd, 1913, Juan Fernandez, a hispanic cobbler worker, returned to the tent of Dolores Rodriguez, where he was living at the time, wearing bloody clothes.  Fernandez was shortly arrested and put on trial at the end of 1913 in the case of \"the State of Arizona v. Juan Fernandez\", which was held in Prescott, Arizona. Juan Fernandez was then convicted of the first degree murder of Jesus Esparcia in the case \"Arizona v. Fernandez\" (1913). His guilty verdict initially came with the death penalty, but was shortly changed to life imprisonment. Amongst the witnesses that took the stand were two females, Mary Woolsey, an indigenous widow from the Yavapai tribe who did not speak English, and Dolores Rodriguez, a Mexican mother. \n\n## Question before the Court\n\n The essential question presented before the Court was should the legal precedent of not allowing non-English speaking and non-citizens to testify as a witness in court be continued in the State of Arizona?  This precedent stemmed from exclusion laws. These laws prohibited citizenship for Native Americans living in the United States, which in turn, mean that they could not testify in court. \n\n## Decision of the Court\n\n Juan Fernandez, along with his two attorneys, J. Ralph Taseher and Neil C. Clark, attempted to appeal Fernandez's guilty verdict in the Arizona Supreme Court, by filing an appeal from the case \"Arizona v. Fernandez\". The Attorney General, G. P. Bullard, and the Assistant to the Attorney General, Leslie C. Hardy, represented the state of Arizona. The appellant team hoped to overturn the guilty verdict by claiming the incompetence of two of the witnesses from the original trial, Mary Woolsey and Dolores Rodriguez. In Mary Woolsey's case, the appellant team claimed that she did not have mental competence, stating that Woolsey's oath giving during her \"voir dire\" was given without Woolsey having a full understanding of what she was committing to. The appellant team also argued that Dolores Rodriguez was incompetent under Section 1226, Penal Code of 1913.  The court, headed by Judge Frank O. Smith, ruled against Fernandez, determining the witnesses Mary Woolsey and Dolores Rodriguez were competent and their testimonies stood according to the interpretation of \"People v. Bradford\" 1 Cal. App. 41, 81 Pac. 712 (1905). This set the precedent in the state of Arizona for allowing non-citizens, women, and non-English speaking people to testify in legal cases.

Together they had a daughter, Charlotte Dalton, who was born in Dublin in 1819. Their marriage was a tempestuous one, with them living most often separated between Paris and London. During this time her lovers included Horace Vernet, Richard Parkes Bonington, and Delacroix. From 1823, she became the pupil and then the mistress of Delacroix, who wrote fiery letters to her. She responded to these with letters and concluded them with the phrase \"la petite amie qui t'aime\" (the girlfriend who loves you). In 1829, Delacroix painted \"Saint Mary Magdalene at the Foot of the Cross\" for Dalton. In 1831, Delacroix painted her portrait and, in 1834, she posed as one of the three subjects of the Women of Algiers. Dalton was mainly known for painting landscapes, still lifes (including \"Still Life with Game\" in the Grand Trianon) as well as animal scenes. She exhibited at all the salons, from the Salon of 1827 to 1840, where her landscapes \"dans la mani\u00e8re anglaise\" were remarked upon by the critic \u00c9tienne-Jean Del\u00e9cluze. The Louvre bought \"Cow in a Stable\" (1832) from her at the Salon of 1833, where she was awarded a second-class medal. Dalton is one of only twenty-one female artists with works in the collections of the Louvre. In 1839, she settled in Algiers and made frequent round trips between Paris and London where her husband had settled in 1843. After the death of her husband, she is believed to have lived in Algiers with her collection of paintings, including those by Delacroix. She died in Algiers on 9 February 9 1859. Her art collection was put up for sale in 1864.

He has an idea to create a company that provides cruise ship tours around the British Isles aimed at passengers on lower incomes who cannot afford expensive foreign travel. After some research, Morrison believes it is a viable scheme. However as they both lack the necessary finances, they approach one of the clients of the travel agency, the millionaire John Stott. Stott agrees to put up the money to acquire a transatlantic liner about to be broken up for scrap. He revises the scheme, moving it away from affordable packages towards expensive luxury for wealthier passengers. The crucial ingredient is the addition of gambling aboard, with a casino that can operate as the ship cruises just outside the three mile limit and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of British authorities. The domineering Stott soon takes charge of the project, and lays out the funds. As well as being given a share in the profits, Morrison is employed as the head of the tourist section arranging excursions to various location in Great Britain and Ireland. The ship is refitted on the Clyde and then registered in France. It launches with great success, while also generating controversy amongst opponents to gambling. The ship proves to be very profitable, but as time passes Morrison and the other partner have still not received their share of the money. Concerns about the damage the ship is doing to Britain's international reputation leads the Prime Minister and Home Secretary to approach the police to take action. Chief Inspector French is assigned to the case, booking a passage under an assumed name and taking his wife along with him for additional cover. He tries to discover evidence of lawbreaking that can have the gambling stopped, but everything is consistent with the law. He has not been aboard long when Stott goes missing during a visit to Portrush and Northern Ireland. An investigation by the RUC turns up the body in a hollow not far from Dunluce Castle. French is brought in to lead the shipboard investigation and is compelled to abandon his false identity. To his discomfort it appears that Morrison, who he likes and is all but engaged to Stott's great niece, has been at the scene of the murder and lied about his presence. French works through the various alibis of the passengers, including two business partners who may have had a grudge against the late Stott. He continually draws a blank, as each possible suspect demonstrates their lack of opportunity or motive to commit the crime. Just as he is beginning to lose hope, French at last manages to crack the case by unravelling one of the complex alibis.", "Firenze Ladies Open": "The Firenze Ladies Open is a WTA 125-level professional women's tennis tournament.

Greenwald is prominently known for his \"Night Car\" series, which depicts deceptively simple compositions of sci-fi, psychedelic Americana landscapes of a car in motion, yet suspended in time. Crafted by hand, the amorphous shape of his artworks adds to the surreal nature of his subject matter, giving them the appearance of a cartoon-like dream bubble. Through painting, sculpture, and assemblage, Greenwald utilizes a highly saturated color palette to emphasize the uncertainty of time and explore the spiritual force of objects. Greenwald\u2019s artistic practice blends comical futurism with an underlying residue of static energy; one dedicated to an individual quest of traveling without meeting a destination. His artworks find resonance with shows like \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d and \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d where the use of the sci-fi genre critiques societal fears of the postmodern, existentialist self in the age of technology and escapism. \n\n## Early life\n\n Eliot Greenwald came from a family of openly creative people.

The dirt sold within two hours, and although Greenwald retold the story from a place of excitement, it was later revealed that his mother convinced a stranger to purchase Greenwald\u2019s display.

Nastos wrote: \"One has to always wonder if Maupin has a magnum opus within him, and this comes close, for it is certainly his most introspective, reflective, and inner spirit-directed effort in a long and varied career playing progressive jazz.\" John Kelman of \"All About Jazz\" stated: \"\"Penumbra\" and the equally outstanding \"Early Reflections\" book-end \"The Jewel in the Lotus\"\u2014a promise Maupin never managed to follow up\u2014demonstrating two very different sides and making it clear that he's truly back and better than ever.\" \"AAJ\"'s Andrey Henkin described the recording as \"an album of vignettes, alternating brief sketches with more fully formed compositions,\" and noted that the members of Maupin's band \"are equally invested in Maupin's aesthetic. That is one of languorous movement, Maupin writing deliberate, organic compositions.\" Writing for \"The New York Times\", Ben Ratliff commented: \"This is patient, well-planned music, and Mr. Maupin's sound on bass clarinet, as well as tenor and soprano saxophone and flute, is provocatively honest and strong and almost plain, with spaces in between phrases; he's never playing too much. It's a remarkably clear-minded record.\" In an article for \"Jazz Times\", Steve Greenlee remarked: \"Patient and emotive, it is destined to be one of the great releases of 2008... This is jazz with a lot of thought and a lot of feeling... the album... feels like a celebration of life on planet Earth.\" \"The Village Voice\"'s Michael J. West wrote: \"\"Reflections\" never feels like a reinvention\u2014merely an artist detouring into a different aspect of himself. That detour just happens to yield something extraordinary.\" Marshall Bowden of New Directions in Music stated: \"\"Early Reflections\" adds another chapter to Maupin's considerable story, and it is a chapter that will no doubt prove to be one of the strongest in an already strong musical story.\" Writing for Something Else!, S. Victor Aaron commented: \"Bennie Maupin's return to being regular recording artist as a leader hasn't been heralded nearly as much as it should be. His mastery of a multitude of instruments... and value as a key sideman tend to overshadow his abilities as both a composer and bandleader. On \"Early Reflections\", he proves that he can do it all well.\"", "Dominik Prpi\u0107": "Dominik Prpi\u0107 (born 19 May 2004) is a Croatian professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Hajduk Split. \n\n## Club career\n\n Prpi\u0107 started practicing football at the age of six at NK Zagreb, until early 2017, when he moved to NK Lokomotiva, but, having been scouted by HNK Hajduk Split, he moved to the Dalmatian club that same summer.

It was originally intended for financing ventures in the Ottoman Empire and the Khedivate of Egypt.  In mid-1914 the Orientbank absorbed the Levantine network of Deutsche Pal\u00e4stina-Bank, established in the late 19th century as an earlier endeavor to develop German economic influence in the Ottoman Empire. \n\n## History\n\n At its founding in 1905-1906, driven by banker and his son , the new venture was sponsored by Dresdner Bank, , and A. Schaaffhausen'scher Bank Association, with respective shares of 37.5 percent for Dresdner and 31.25 percent for each of the other two. It was part of a broader German push to gain influence in the Ottoman Empire, also involving Deutsche Bank and the financing of the Berlin\u2013Baghdad railway. The newly established Orientbank soon took over the branches in Hamburg and Constantinople of , a stillborn venture of National Bank of Greece, initially in partnership with Nationalbank f\u00fcr Deutschland but with the latter soon replaced by France's Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris. Initially the Orientbank was kept out of major deals by the dominant alliance of Deutsche Bank and the Imperial Ottoman Bank, but gained influence following the Young Turk Revolution in 1908. In addition to the Berlin head office and the branches in Constantinople and Hamburg, by 1913 it had opened in Adana, Bursa, Dedea\u011fa\u00e7, and Mersin. It also opened six branches in Egypt; in Tangier and Casablanca at the request of the German government; and briefly in the Balkans. Following the establishment of the French protectorate in Morocco in 1912, the Orientbank sold the two branches there in 1913 to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. In mid-1914, Orientbank took over the branch network of Deutsche Pal\u00e4stina-Bank (DPB), which had been established in Berlin in 1896-1899 with branches and offices in Jaffa, Jerusalem, Gaza and later in Beirut (1907), Damascus and Tripoli (1910), and Alexandretta (1913). The German business of DPB was separately restructured by the Nationalbank f\u00fcr Deutschland. During World War I, the activity of the Orientbank's in Egypt was suspended by the British authorities. In 1916, the Schaaffhausen'scher Bankverein withdrew from the Orientbank, selling its shares to a consortium of German and Austrian-Hungarian banks. After the war, the bank's Levantine network was liquidated by the Public Custodian of Enemy Property under British rule. By 1919-1920, it had branches in Constantinople (main branch in Sirkeci and branch offices in Galata, Pera, and Kad\u0131k\u00f6y); in Adana, Bursa, Edirne, and Mersin; in Aleppo in Syria; and in Egypt in Alexandria, Beni Suef, Cairo, Damanhur, Mansoura, Minya, and Tanta. The European banking crisis of 1931 led to the collapse of the Orientbank's two main shareholders, namely Dresdner and Danatbank (as Nationalbank f\u00fcr Deutschland had merged with Darmst\u00e4dter Bank in 1922), and to an incipient subsequent bank run on the Orientbank itself. Following the two German banks' merger and rescue, the newly strengthened Dresdner Bank took over the Orientbank's Egyptian branch network. Dresdner also became sole owner of Orientbank in Turkey, but kept operating it under the Orientbank brand name. The Orientbank was involved in Nazi transactions in stolen gold, for which Istanbul was a hub, and was eventually liquidated in 1946. \n\n## Buildings\n\n The head office in Berlin was successively at Markgrafenstrasse 56, then Franz\u00f6sische Strasse 29.

The outer bays were fenestrated by tri-partite windows on the ground floor and by bi-partite windows with dormer heads on the first floor. Following significant population growth, largely associated with the development of the area as a new town, East Kilbride became a small burgh in 1963.

The design involved a five-storey rectangular wing adjacent to Andrew Street with two lower rise structures extending eastwards behind the building. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber, the district courtroom and an entertainments venue known as the Ballerup Hall which had a seating capacity of 300 people. The hall was named after Ballerup, East Kilbride's twin town in Denmark. A Wurlitzer concert organ with two manuals and ten pipe ranks was installed in the hall. Following local government re-organisation in 1975, the building became the headquarters of the enlarged East Kilbride District Council, but it ceased to be the local seat of government when the new unitary authority, South Lanarkshire Council, was formed at Hamilton in 1996. However, it continued to be used by South Lanarkshire Council as a base for the delivery of local services. In February 2022, the council considered a masterplan for the town centre: options for the civic centre in the document included ongoing investment to restore the crumbling concrete on the building, or demolishing it and replacing it with a more modern civic structure.", "Edna Leedom": "Edna Leedom Doelger (1896 \u2013 October 15, 1937) was an American actress, who appeared in Broadway productions during the 1920s. \n\n## Early life\n\n Edna Leedom was born in 1896.

Malinowski (October 1932 \u2013 February 2020) was an American professor of chemistry and is considered to be one of the great pioneers of the field of chemometrics. He published over 70 research papers and his 1980 book, \"Factor Analysis in Chemistry\" is acknowledged to be the first text on factor analysis applied to chemistry. \u00a0Malinowski is credited with having an \u201cenormous impact\u201d on the field of chemometrics and the researchers who followed him. \n\n## Education\n\n Edmund R. Malinowski was born in October 1932 in Mahanoy City, PA. He obtained a Bachelor of Science in chemistry from The Pennsylvania State University in 1954. He obtained both a MS degree (1956) and PhD (1961) in physical chemistry at Stevens Institute of Technology, and was a Robert Crooks Stanley Graduate Fellow as a student during those years. \n\n## Career\n\n Malinowski went on to a long, distinguished academic career at the Stevens Institute of Technology. He joined the Institute\u2019s chemistry faculty in 1965 and became a full professor there in 1970. The Institute awarded him the 1977 Jess H. Research Award for his work on the theory and applications of factor analysis, and the 1994 Henry Morton Distinguished Professor Award, which honors excellence in research and teaching. He retired from Stevens Institute of Technology in 1997. Paul Gemperline summarized Malinowski's work at the time of his retirement in a \"Journal of Chemometrics\" editorial: \"Over the course of his career as a chemist and educator he has published over 70 research papers and presented over 200 papers at seminars and professional meetings.\"  \n\n## Research\n\n Before chemometrics was identified and named as a field of research and study by Kowalski and Wold in 1974, Malinowski was publishing work that would be regarded as chemometrics. His first paper on factor analysis was published in 1966. \n\n## Influence and Recognition\n\n According to Paul Gemperline, prior to Malinowski's 1980 book, \"Factor Analysis in Chemistry\", \"factor analysis and principal component analysis were virtually unknown in the world of chemistry.\" Gemperline goes on to say Malinowski's book was \"influential\" not only because of the \"timely\" introduction of these topics but also because he had a \"clear writing style \u2026 that chemists could understand\". Malinowski was known to be generous in his acknowledgement and recognition of the work of others, citing their work in his own presentations and publications, which helped younger researchers to be successful. Malinowski was recognized by his peers as a leader in the field of chemometrics in 1998 when he was awarded the Galactic Industries Award for Achievements in Chemometrics.

He was dropped in the Netherlands in June 1943 and played an important role in the escape of Allied pilots from occupied territory until the end of the war. \n\n## Lifetime\n\n \n\n## Youth\n\n Kragt had a Dutch father and an English mother. He grew up in England, but spoke fluent Dutch. He received English citizenship in 1938. \n\n## Second World War\n\n \n\n## Dropped in the Netherlands\n\n During the war, he applied for training as a secret agent. The secret service MI9 decided to drop Kragt in the Netherlands. There, he was to set up an escape line for pilots who had crashed over the Netherlands. Kragt considered being picked up by a reception committee too dangerous. Therefore, he had made it a condition that he would be dropped \"blind\". The three first attempts on 10, 19, and 22 June 1943 all failed for different reasons. On the third attempt, the plane was badly damaged by anti-aircraft fire, forcing an emergency landing on its return to England. The fourth attempt on the night of 23-24 June 1943 was successful. Kragt was to be dropped on the Wisselseveld, an open field near Epe. However, the target was missed. Instead, Kragt was dropped eight kilometres south above Vaassen. He landed between some houses. His equipment, including the transmitter, ended up in the garden of an NSB man with much noise. Kragt himself managed to escape, but without the transmitter. As a result, the German occupying forces now knew that a secret agent had landed. \n\n## Aiding pilots\n\n Kragt made contact with Jacobus van den Boogert from Emst. Through an \"Engelandvaarder\", MI9 knew that Van den Boogert was involved in the resistance and sheltered Jews. Van den Boogert offered Kragt, who had the pseudonym Frans Hals, a hiding place in a forest near his house. Through Van den Boogert, Kragt came into contact with the resistance group Landelijke Organisatie voor Hulp aan Onderduikers (LO) and Nel Lind of the resistance group Fiat Libertas. Through Mrs. Van den Boogert, Kragt came into contact with Joop Piller and his wife. Together with an adopted child, the Jewish couple was in hiding in a teahouse near Schaveren. Piller first of all restored the fake identity card Kragt had brought with him from England. The lion printed on this document was looking in the wrong direction. Lind and Van den Boogert, along with several others, were arrested in September 1943. Piller and Kragt then rented a house at 158 Essenerweg in Essen, near Kootwijkerbroek. Piller and Kragt gathered a number of collaborators around them. The resistance group came to be known as the Frans Hals group. The collaborators included Evert and Maria Bruinekreeft, Heimen van Esveld, Huib de Iongh, courier Puck de Jongh, Ep van Omme, Joop Roskam, and Elbert van der Wiel. From London, Kragt was sent another assistant, but he turned out to be totally unsuitable for the job and was quickly removed via the escape line. Because Kragt had lost his transmitter, it was not possible to verify the data of Allied pilots in England. This was necessary because the Germans also sometimes sent traitors out, posing as pilots and thus being able to roll up the entire escape line. Eventually, Kragt and Piller got in touch with another secret agent, Garrelt van Borssum Buisman. Until his arrest in February 1944, his transmitter could be used. Shortly afterwards, Kragt got his own transmitter. Through a postman and a reliable policeman, Kragt and Piller had access to fifty addresses, mainly in the Kootwijkerbroek area, where pilots could be temporarily housed. The pilots reached them again mainly through LO channels. Kragt set up the resistance group \"Groep-Vrij\" in Maastricht. At least one hundred and twenty pilots were evacuated to Belgium along this line. \n\n## Operation Pegasus II\n\n After the Battle of Arnhem in September 1944, which was lost by the Allies, many British paratroopers were left behind in the region. Kragt and Piller played a key role in Operation Pegasus II in November 1944. During this operation, the resistance wanted to smuggle a large number of British soldiers and downed pilots right through the German lines towards liberated territory. Together with secret agent Abraham du Bois and others, Kragt and Piller were responsible for gathering the Allied soldiers. Kragt disapproved of Major Airey Neave's decision to designate Lunteren as the assembly point because it was far too far from the Rhine. This increased the chances of discovery. Neave stuck to his position, however, as he did not want to endanger the Dutch host families any longer than necessary. \n\n## Last months of war\n\n Kragt himself did not take part in the crossing, which was just as well, as a large number of the participants were caught by the Germans. Only seven men reached the other side of the Rhine. About 60 men managed to stay out of German hands. They were accommodated by Kragt in and around Ede, Meulunteren and Kootwijkerbroek. In December 1944, Kragt was made responsible not only for providing a suitable escape route, but also for taking care of the Airbornes who stayed behind. From early 1945, he was assisted in this by secret agent Henk van Loenen. With the help of Hans Snoek, a route via the Biesbosch was found in February 1945. Via this route, brigadier general John Hackett and doctor Alexander Lipmann Kessel, among others, were evacuated. In the final months of the war, it became increasingly difficult for Kragt to maintain contact with his superiors in liberated territory. The Germans tried to locate the transmitter of his marconist Dirk Hildebrand Last, forcing him to move each time. In early April 1945, Kragt received orders that the twenty soldiers still in occupied territory were no longer allowed to be transferred because liberation was imminent.  \n\n## After the war\n\n Kragt worked for Philips and KLM after the war. He met Norwegian Karin Rosted during a holiday, and married her. The couple had a son. In the 1970s, the family emigrated to Norway, where his wife died in 1995. Kragt visited the Netherlands for the last time in 1994 to attend a reunion of Arnhem veterans and resistance fighters. \n\n## Honours\n\n The Dutch government gave Kragt the Bronzen Leeuw for his wartime commitment.

The border with Bulgaria was established two dozen kilometers north of the village, along the ridge of Kerkini. During the First World War, the village was once again occupied by the Bulgarians. After the defeat of Bulgaria and during the Greek-Bulgarian population exchange, the Bulgarian-speaking part of the population left the village.

Beer had been interested in languages since childhood. From 1817 he attended a high school in his hometown. Two years later he began to learn the Hebrew language, but also dealt with the Semitic languages in general. Because his father died in 1827, Beer had problems financing his studies, so he worked as a proofreader on the side, despite a serious illness in 1828. Beer knew Hebrew, English, French, Italian and Sanskrit. In addition to his university work, he studied gardening and chess. Even during his time as a professor, he received no salary apart from a few bonuses, so that he was impoverished throughout his life. On April 5, 1841, he died in Leipzig at the age of 35 from a hemorrhage, which was the result of a lung disease that Beer had been suffering from since his youth. \n\n## Career\n\n From Easter 1824 he began studying oriental studies at the University of Leipzig. His teachers were Ernst Friedrich Karl Rosenm\u00fcller, Gustav Seyffarth and Heinrich Leberecht Fleischer.

That same year, the philosophical faculty hired him as a private lecturer. During this time, Beer wrote for literary magazines, rather irregularly, since he had to prepare his lectures. In 1838, after a review of cuneiform inscriptions by other researchers in the \"\", he was finally promoted to associate professor of Semitic paleography. He held this office until his death.

Some researchers suggest that the initial sound Dz- in standard Ukrainian should correspond to the sound Z-, and the cluster -em- is a remnant of the sound -\u0119-, which in Ukrainian turned into the sound -u-. This led to the assumption that the name Dzembronia, via the early, Polish-influenced adjectival form *z\u01ebbr\u044a (\"toothed, serrated, jagged\"), may derive from the Proto-Slavic word *z\u01ebb\u044a - \"tooth\", e.g. in the meaning of a rock protrusion.

The \"Yadavabhyudaya\" is regarded to be a significant work of medieval Sanskrit poetry.

The defeat of Putana, Keshi, Kaliya, as well as other malicious beings are recounted. The fifth and the sixth cantos offer an illustration of the seasons and sacred imagery.

For example, under this approach a per-kWh pricing of an electric utility includes a small share of the monthly fixed cost of the utility, fixed (say, monthly) charges for the service are either absent of inconsequential.  The volumetric pricing, in addition to the easy-to-understand structure, encourages the customers to lower the use of the resource. For example, if the (very significant) fixed costs of the electricity service were recovered through the monthly fixed payments, then the per-unit price would have been much lower thus encouraging additional consumption. Conversely, the volumetric price disincentivizes the utility from investing in conservation: if the customers will use less of the resources, the utility sales and will shrink, reducing the fixed-cost portion and causing the \"lost revenues\" and under-investment. Therefore this pricing strategy is typically coupled at the regulatory level with an annual rate adjustment mechanism (also known as \"revenue-decoupling\" policy).

Often at the center of partisan controversy, Murphy regarded those who held that the states had a right to secede from the Union as those who harbored Communist sympathies. He supported the Supreme Court's decision against racial segregation in public schools. For his strong stance over this view he was fired by Governor Ross Barnett, and others of his political persuasion, all of whom supported racial segregation. Murphy was a member of the ACLU. In 1960 when the state college board refused to renew his teaching contract, Murphy claimed that it was over his membership in the ACLU. Rather than fight with the Mississippi college board, he resigned from the law school. During his teaching sessions Murphy argued against the belief that the doctrine of State's rights allowed Mississippi to disregard the Supreme Court's decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" which is said to have been based on Constitutional principles.

", "Wilberforce Road": "Wilberforce Road is a street in the western outskirts of Cambridge, England, which runs north\u2013south for 550\u00a0metres, connecting Madingley Road with Adams Road, which runs eastwards to Grange Road. The road was built in 1933, although several of its buildings date from earlier in the 20th century. It was named for William Wilberforce, the anti-slavery campaigner. Wilberforce Road falls within the conservation area of West Cambridge. As of 2022, the usage is a mix of private housing and buildings and sports facilities associated with the university and colleges, including the Centre for Mathematical Sciences. There are two listed buildings, Emmanuel College's sports pavilion (1910) and the Modernist-style number 9 (1936\u201337). \n\n## History\n\n A drift existed on the route, which connected St John's Grange Farm to Madingley Road, and a handful of agricultural cottages (dating from 1905) and bungalows (1926) pre-date the road construction. The local historian Philomena Guillebaud notes that the bungalows are the only working-class housing to be built on land belonging to St John's College in west Cambridge, other than those housing the college's own agricultural workers. St John's College sold of land now lying on the west of the road to Emmanuel College in 1907 for sports grounds, and a sports pavilion and adjoining groundsman's house and stable were constructed in 1910 for Emmanuel. Wilberforce Road was constructed in 1933 by the borough council, funded by St John's College, which owned the land and wished to develop it, with contribution from Emmanuel College. It was named for William Wilberforce, a student at John's, to mark the centenary of the abolition of slavery across the British Empire. It is connected to Grange Road, which runs broadly parallel to the east, by Clarkson Road, built at the same time, and Adams Road (1898). St John's College leased building plots of for 99\u00a0years on both Wilberforce and Clarkson Roads, with 17 plots having been taken up on the two streets by 1939. After the Second World War, a row of maisonettes was built at the northern end, on the west side, and a larger private residential development occurred at the southern end on the east side, also on Adams Road. In 1989, the university tried to build an athletics centre on a site off the road's southern end, but failed to gain planning permission; the plans were reduced to a pavilion and running track, which was started in 1993. Plans were initiated in 1997 to move the university's mathematical departments to a site off Wilberforce and Clarkson Roads, adjacent to the existing Isaac Newton Institute. The original plans for three-storey buildings met with opposition from residents, and a new plans for partially underground buildings were substituted. Construction commenced in 1998, and the Centre for Mathematical Sciences was completed in around 2002. \n\n## Buildings and features\n\n Wilberforce Road falls within the West Cambridge Conservation Area. Among the buildings that pre-date the road itself, the most notable is Emmanuel College's sports pavilion with its adjoining groundsman's house and stable (now number 38), completed in 1910. It was designed by the London architects Reginald Francis Wheatly and Edward Ford Duncanson, and is listed at grade II, as a rare example of a surviving Edwardian sports pavilion complete with ancillary buildings. The listing notes that its \"complex roofscape of steep, sweeping pitches\" lend it a \"picturesque character\". The road contains two of the eleven surviving Modernist-style buildings to be built in Cambridge during the 1930s. The grade-II-listed number 9, by Dora Cosens for the zoologist William Homan Thorpe (1936\u20131937), is constructed in rendered brick on a square plan. The concrete roof has a roof canopy. Number 19 by H. C. Hughes was built for the historian Zachary N. Brooke (1933\u20131934), but is considerably altered from its original state. Additionally 31 Madingley Road, a grade-II-listed Modernist red-brick house by Marshall Sisson (1931\u20131932), stands on the east side of the junction. (Another cluster of pre-war Modernist houses is located on nearby Conduit Head Road, on the north side of Madingley Road.) In the interwar period substantial traditional-style houses such as number 7 (1937\u20131938) were also built on Wilberforce Road. Number 11 (1950\u20131951) was one of the first post-war Modernist buildings in Cambridge, and number 1 was built in 1965 by the architect John Youngman for himself. University facilities include the Centre for Mathematical Sciences on the east side, built to an unusual design by Ted Cullinan. It features a central hub building with a series of six individual pavilions. In \"The Buildings of England\" series, Simon Bradley describes it as among Cullinan's best work, \"at once wildly imaginative and tightly disciplined\", and compares the pavilions to pagodas or stupas. The Cambridge University Athletics Sportsground is off the south end of Wilberforce Road, and Emmanuel College's Sports Ground lies on the south-west side, with the Cambridge Lawn Tennis Club adjacent, on Stacey's Lane. The Adams Road Bird Sanctuary, a local wildlife sanctuary with an artificial lake and woodland, lies between Wilberforce Road and Grange Road, and can be seen from Wilberforce Road. The lake is fed by damming Coton Stream, a tributary of Bin Brook, which continues westwards to reach Wilberforce Road, turns north to run alongside the road for around half its length, and then crosses the road and flows westwards. The southern end of Wilberforce Road links to the Coton Footpath, a joint cycle path and footpath, which runs westwards to the village of Coton. \n\n## References\n\n Sources", "Welsh bow": "The Welsh bow or Welsh longbow was a medieval weapon used by Welsh soldiers.

The Dogon story of the creation of the world relates that the sky god Amma mated with the earth goddess, and because Amma was prevented from joining the goddess's clitoris in the form of a giant termite mound, he produced only an imperfect offspring \u2013 a desert fox or jackal \u2013 and therefore eventually removed the termite mound. Leaving the earth, he instituted the religious ritual of female circumcision. After removing the termite mound, the god Amma with the earth goddess continued procreating and begat humans. Duality is central to Dogon religion, the heavenly forces also have a dual character: the supreme god Amma has androgynous characteristics. The birth of twins is celebrated among the Dogon with a special religious ritual, as twins refer to the original dual structure of creation and to the harmony between earthly and heavenly. Key figures in Dogon religion are the twins Nummo and Nommo, primal spirits of Dogon ancestors, sometimes seen as deities. These are hermaphroditic water creatures, seen similarly to water deities (to-vodun) in West African vodun; they can be depicted with a human body and a fish tail. Nommo is supposed to be the first living creature created by the supreme god Amma. Shortly after his creation, Nommo spawned into four pairs of twins, with one pair defying the order established by creator Amma. To restore order, the god Amma sacrificed another creature, whose body he cut up and scattered throughout creation. A shrine for the god Amma was to be built at each place where a fragment of the body landed. The cult of the god Amma \u2013 like the entire Dogon religion \u2013 is closely tied to the Bandiagara cliff where the Dogon live. The cult of the god Amma is geographically defined by this cliff, it is not practiced elsewhere. The Bandiagara cliff is a sandstone terrain fault approximately 150\u00a0km long, reaching a height of up to 500 m in some places. The Dogon inhabit mud villages built on the upper edge of the cliff, villages directly attached to the cliff at its lower edge, but also at various heights in the wall, also villages scattered under the cliff and a labyrinth of caves right in the cliff. The architecture of the villages and the religiously motivated urban arrangement of mud houses centered on the hogon priestly building is unique in the context of the whole of Africa.

", "Aristocritus (writer)": "Aristocritus () was a Christian, Platonist writer of the fifth century who was the author of a work titled \"Theosophy\", ostensibly about oracles, but in which he expressed a controversial syncretic belief that Christianity, Judaism, and Manichaeism were all basically the same. This belief caused him to be condemned by Zacharias Rhetor as well as in various later Byzantine texts. He is known to us primarily by his mention in a list of medieval anathemas, written around the year 1000, known as the \"Long Anathema\", primarily aimed at Manichaeans. His identification as a Manichaean is however considered somewhat dubious, as he was known to write uncharitable things about Mani himself. \"Theosophy\" is a lost work, though some scholars have identified this with the so-called T\u00fcbingen Theosophy. Other scholars disagree that these are the same works.", "Andreas Fernholm": "Andreas Fernholm (7 May 1840 \u2013 9 May 1892) was a priest in the Church of Sweden, later leader of the Baptist Union of Sweden, teacher for the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden and hymnwriter. \n\n## Biography\n\n Andreas Fernholm was born in 1840 in S\u00f6r-H\u00f6rende in V\u00e4stmanland, son of crofter Anders Persson and Anna Persdotter. After support from vicar I. A. Nordblad in V\u00e4sterf\u00e4rnebo, he studied at V\u00e4ster\u00e5s h\u00f6gre elementarl\u00e4roverk, graduated in Uppsala in May 1863, began studying theology in Uppsala in October 1864 and was ordained on 30 November 1866 by Archbishop Henrik Reuterdahl. Through his teacher in Uppsala, , he came into contact with the Swedish Evangelical Mission ( and became good friends with founder , in whose home he celebrated Christmas 1865. During the summer of 1868 he met Paul Petter Waldenstr\u00f6m and \u2013 two other prominent leaders of the \"Nyevangelism\" ('new evangelism') revival and distributed communion with them outside of church gatherings. In May 1870, Fernholm was given leave of absence from his priestly duties to work as director of the Mission School in Kristinehamn, a school for future preachers and missionaries run by the V\u00e4rmland Ansgar Association, and worked closely with Erik Jakob Ekman there. The two worked as editors for the publication . During his time in Kristinehamn, he traveled extensively in V\u00e4rmland and \u00d6rebro County, preaching in churches and serving communion associations with communion. In 1871, he married Gerda Andreetta Lignell (1849\u20131914), daughter of provost Anders Lignell and Regina Matilda Poignant. After two years, he left his post and resigned from the priesthood in the Church of Sweden (and was dismissed from the priesthood on 26 May 1872) and was baptized a Baptist in G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv. With Fernholm's resignation, the communion associations in the V\u00e4rmland Ansgar Association and the \u00d6rebro County Ansgar Association lost access to a priest who could serve them with communion, and many of them took the step of appointing a layman to lead communion, which was illegal at the time. This contributed to the formation of the Swedish Mission Covenant, later the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden, in 1878. As a Baptist, Fernholm founded a new mission school, became a district chairman, and published a periodical called ('The Sign of the Times'). He served as assistant pastor at Gothenburg Baptist Church with . When the dispute broke out over Waldenstr\u00f6m's subjective doctrine of atonement, Fernholm sided with Waldenstr\u00f6m. This made it difficult for him to remain within the Baptist movement and in 1880 he joined the Swedish Mission Covenant led by Waldenstr\u00f6m. Fernholm called for Christian unity, stating \"The Bible knows nothing of Lutherans or Calvinists or Wesleyans but much about Christians who believe in Christ and are buried with him through baptism to death.\" Fernholm died in Stockholm in 1892. Fernholm is also known as a hymnwriter.", "Antoine Green": "Antoine Green (born November 15, 1999) is an American football wide receiver for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at North Carolina. \n\n## College career\n\n As a freshman at North Carolina in 2018, Green appeared in five games at wide receiver and on special teams, and posted four receptions for 45 yards.

The policy was then formulated in the MPR RI resolution No. II/MPR/1983 elucidating State Policy Guidelines () which stated that political parties and the Functional Groups (Official term for Golkar Party) must be the formidable political and social might that have Pancasila as their one and only ideology maintain and preserve the national ideology. Political parties and the Functional Groups became the first institution with an obligation to adhere to the single principle basis, per Law No. 3 of 1983 on Political Parties. The obligation was extended to all public organisations through Law No. 8 of 1985 on Public Organisation passed on 17 June 1985.  Following the fall of the New Order in 1998, political liberalisation resulted in the abolition of the single-principle requirement for political parties and mass organisations. \n\n## Response\n\n The single-principle obligation received mixed reaction among Indonesian Muslims. While major Muslim organisations Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) endorsed the single-principle basis, independent Muslim activists rejected the obligation. NU argued that Pancasila consist of values that are not in opposite to Islam. Furthermore, at the NU Congress in 1984, the organisation issued a resolution affirming the final status of Pancasila, which they said merely a philosophical value and will not replace the religion, and the 1945 Constitution. However, NU also declared their withdrawal from politics at the same congress and decided to focus on social works, which they continue until now. Meanwhile, Muhammadiyah also accepted the obligation by pointing out that Muhammadiyah figures, such as Ki Bagus Hadikusumo, Kahar Muzakkir, and Kasman Singodimedjo, participated in the formulation of Pancasila before the independence declaration on 17 August 1945. In the opposite, Muslim activists who aspired to establish an Islamic state in Indonesia, rejected the single-principle obligation. As the result, some of them were jailed by the authority, or escaped overseas to avoid arrest. Abu Bakar Baasyir left Indonesia and stayed in Malaysia in a self-imposed exile for 17 years after being arrested for his rejection to the policy. Ba'asyir returned to Indonesia only after the fall of Suharto in 1998.", "Amanita galactica": "Amanita galactica is a species of agaric fungus in the family \"Amanitaceae\", first described by Giuliana Furci and Bryn Dentinger in 2020.

The epithet \"galactica\" was given by Furci, and was inspired by the bright white spots on the black cap that reminded her of a galaxy dotted with stars. ", "Anti-Terrorism Act 1997": "The Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 is a Pakistani law that was enacted to provide a legal framework for the prevention and control of terrorism in the country. The law was passed by the National Assembly of Pakistan on 20 August 1997, and subsequently signed into law by then-President Farooq Leghari. \n\n## Background\n\n Pakistan has been plagued by terrorism for several decades, with numerous attacks targeting civilians, government officials, and security forces. The government of Pakistan recognized the need for a legal framework to combat terrorism and enacted the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 in response to the growing threat. \n\n## Provisions\n\n The Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 defines terrorism as an act committed with the intention to intimidate the government or the public or a section of the public or to cause death or injury to any person. The law provides for the investigation, prosecution, and punishment of terrorism-related offenses, including the financing of terrorism, and the use of explosives and firearms. Special anti-terrorism courts were established under the Act to try terrorism-related cases. These courts have the power to try cases in camera, use anonymous witnesses, and withhold the identity of the accused in certain circumstances. The Act also empowers law enforcement agencies to take a range of measures to prevent and control terrorism, including the power to arrest and detain suspects, conduct searches and seizures, and intercept communications. \n\n## Controversies\n\n Critics of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 have raised concerns about its potential misuse by law enforcement agencies and the violation of fundamental rights and freedoms, such as the right to a fair trial and due process. In recent years, the law has been subject to several amendments aimed at addressing some of these concerns. In 2013, the Pakistani government passed the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Ordinance, which amended the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 to provide for the establishment of special trial courts to deal with terrorism-related offenses. The ordinance was criticized by human rights groups for its potential to violate due process and fair trial guarantees. In 2020, the Pakistani government passed the Anti-Terrorism (Third Amendment) Bill, which further amended the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997. The bill introduced several new provisions, including the power to detain suspects for up to 90 days without charge and the establishment of a new appellate tribunal to hear appeals against decisions of the special trial courts.", "Alice Auersperg": "Alice Auersperg is an Austrian cognitive biologist specializing in the evolution of intelligence in birds.

The head is longer than it is wide. The snout is truncate in dorsal view and projecting, obliquely sloping in profile. The tympanum is distinct. The fingers are slender and bear weak dermal fringes. The finger tips are slightly swollen into weakly spatulate discs. The toes are moderately webbed and have tips swollen into small discs. The dorsum is brown with darker markings, often forming a reticulate pattern. The lore and lips are barred with orange-yellow.

He belonged to the knighthood. \n\n## Life\n\n Under the Roman Emperor Nero, Serenus was entrusted with the office of \"praefectus vigilum\", i.e. he was the chief of the Roman fire brigade, which kept watch at night all over the city and ensured that fires that frequently broke out in Rome were quickly extinguished. Under Emperor Claudius - as mentioned by the historian Tacitus - Decrius Calpurnianus was still chief of the fire guard. He was executed for involvement in an attempted coup in 48 A.D. Laelianus held the office until 54, when he was transferred to Armenia. The British historian Miriam Griffin suspects that Serenus received the office of \"praefectus vigilum\" after 54 and died before 62, before Tigellinus held the office. He may have benefited from intercession on the part of his friend Seneca. As can be seen from Seneca's treatises and letters, Serenus suffered from doubts about life and thought of withdrawing from public life. He therefore also sought the philosophical advice of his friend. In Seneca's treatise \"On the Tranquillity of the Soul\" (\"De Tranquillitate Animi\"), a letter from Annaeus Serenus to Seneca is reproduced at the beginning, from which it becomes apparent how much Serenus was attracted to a simple life of moderation, and at the same time how much he was irritated by the hectic pursuit of state positions of honour and a life of luxury that he observed all around him. While Serenus was initially close to Epicurean thought, under Seneca's influence he moved closer to the philosophy of the Stoa and decided to remain at the imperial court. Seneca dedicated to his friend the writings \"De Constantia Sapientis\" and \"De Tranquillitate Animi\" and perhaps (for the name is again erased in the Index of the Ambrosianus) \"De Otio\".  As Tacitus reports, Serenus played a helpful role in the young Emperor Nero's love affair with the freedwoman Claudia Acte by providing the Emperor's favourite, who suffered under the surveillance of his mother Agrippina, with the latter's secret gifts. According to the writer Pliny the Elder, Serenus was murdered with a meal of poisoned mushrooms (probably around 62/63 AD). Seneca, by his own account, \"mourned the death of his friend immoderately.\"", "Anna-Belle Str\u00f6mberg": "Lissi Anna-Belle Str\u00f6mberg (born 1965) is a Swedish politician and member of the Riksdag, the national legislature.

He was an activist of the anarchist movement of Ancona, where he was employed by the State Railways as a technical designer. In 1921, he was transferred to Parma due to his political activity. There, during the Parma Barricades, in August 1922 together with Guido Picelli, who directed the entire anti-fascist formation, he was commander of the \"Arditi del Popolo\" in the defense of the Naviglio, a popular district of Parma, against the assaults of Italo Balbo's fascist squads. In 1923, he was fired from the State Railways and went into exile. In Paris, he resumed his activity as a militant anarchist by publishing the periodical \"Umanit\u00e0 Nova\".

He was credited with five aerial victories. Born in Gateshead, Blake joined the RN in early 1939 and was assigned to the Fleet Air Arm for flight training. After the Battle of France, Blake was seconded to the Royal Air Force's Fighter Command due to a shortage of pilots. Posted to No. 19 Squadron as a reinforcement pilot in July, he flew extensively during the Battle of Britain and destroyed a number of German aircraft. He was killed in action two days before the official conclusion of the Battle of Britain. \n\n## Early life\n\n One of eight children of John Blake, a sales representative, and his wife Mary, Arthur Giles Blake was born on 12 September 1917 in Gateshead, England. His family subsequently moved to Slough where he was educated. Following the completion of his schooling, Blake worked as a clerk. In 1938, he applied to join the Royal Navy (RN) on a short service commission with a view to becoming a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA). He was accepted and entered the RN early the following year. Blake, holding the rank of a midshipman, was first posted to the Royal Naval College at Greenwich. Then, in August he went to No. 20 Elementary Flying Training school, a Royal Air Force (RAF) facility at Gravesend, where he learnt to fly de Havilland Tiger Moth trainers. The following month he was promoted to acting sub-lieutenant. \n\n## Second World War\n\n In November 1939, and with the Second World War well under way, Blake proceeded to No. 1 Flying Training School at Netheravon. Here he flew the more advanced North American Harvard trainer before switching to the Fairey Battle, a light bomber. He gained his wings in March 1940, and the same month was confirmed as a sub-lieutenant. Further training followed, this time on the Blackburn Skua, designed as a carrier-borne fighter and dive bomber. \n\n## Battle of Britain\n\n Following the Battle of France, RAF's Fighter Command had lost many of its pilots and was in need of urgent replacements to shore up the aerial defences of the United Kingdom. To help with this shortfall, in June the Admiralty seconded over fifty of its FAA pilots, Blake among them, to Fighter Command. Before being posted to a fighter squadron, he went to No. 7 Operational Training Unit to become familiar with the Supermarine Spitfire fighter. In July he was assigned to No. 19 Squadron, where he would have the nicknames 'Admiral' and 'Sailor'. He stood out from the RAF pilots on account of his dark blue naval uniform. His new unit operated Spitfires from Duxford as part of No. 12 Group, carrying out convoy patrols over the North Sea. Blake's first few weeks with the squadron were quiet and his first engagement with the Luftwaffe was not until 25 August, when his squadron and two others engaged a fleet of aircraft over the Thames estuary. As the Battle of Britain escalated, No. 19 Squadron became drawn into the aerial fighting over London. However, its effectiveness was hampered by faults with the cannon armament being trialed in its aircraft and at the start of September it reverted to Spitfires fitted with machine guns. On 3 September Blake damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter south of Colchester on 3 September and six days later shot down a Heinkel He 111 medium bomber over London.  On 15 September, later known as Battle of Britain Day, the Luftwaffe mounted two large scale bombing attacks on London. No. 19 Squadron was one of five squadrons scrambled in the morning as part of the Duxford Wing, the first time this many fighters had been used in a 'Big Wing' formation. The Duxford Wing was scrambled again in the afternoon but was still climbing when it was engaged by several Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters protecting the attacking bombers. Squadron Leader Douglas Bader, commanding the wing, ordered No. 19 Squadron to seek out the bombers while he led the three Hawker Hurricane fighter squadrons in engaging the Bf 109s. During the course of the day, Blake damaged a Dornier Do 17 medium bomber, destroyed a Bf 109, and with three other pilots, shared in the destruction of a He 111, all over London. His Spitfire damaged, he crash-landed following the afternoon scramble but without injury. On 17 September, while flying a sortie over Canterbury, Blake destroyed two Bf 109s. Flying at the rear of No. 19 Squadron while on a sortie on 29 October, two days before the end of the Battle of Britain, Blake was attacked by Bf 109s. Unseen by the rest of the squadron, he was killed when his Spitfire crashed near Chelmsford in Essex. He was one of seven FAA pilots to lose their lives in the Battle of Britain.  Blake is credited with having shot down five German aircraft, one being shared with three other pilots, and damaging two others.

Its current designation as the Arch of Portugal is derived from its location where it stood against the Palazzo Fiano, where from 1488 to 1508 lived the Portuguese cardinal Jorge da Costa, Cardinal Priest of the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina. \n\n## History and description\n\n The dating of the arch has long been the subject of controversy. For many years it was believed that the arch formed part of an aqueduct branch, with most suggestions linking it to the Aqua Virgo. However, most modern studies now attribute the arch to the period of late antiquity, possibly during the reign of Aurelian (270\u2013275), hypothesising that it acted as a monumental entry into his enormous Temple of the Sun. In any event, the arch displayed reliefs that belonged to the period of the reign of the emperor Hadrian (117\u2013138), some 140 years before Aurelian's reign. It is suspected that these reliefs were repurposed as spolia in order to decorate the monument built under Aurelian, in much the same way earlier reliefs from Trajan were reused when decorating the arch of Constantine. Of the extant reliefs, one depicts a scene of the donation of food relief to Roman children, presided over by the emperor Hadrian, while a second shows the apotheosis of Vibia Sabina (the emperor's deceased wife). Uncovered at a separate location from the others, but most likely related, the \"adventus\" of Hadrian shows the emperor welcomed by three personifications, representing the goddess Roma, the Roman Senate, and the people of Rome. This third relief was uncovered in the piazza Sciarra. The arch was constructed in blocks of peperino and travertine, with the arch's attic in brick. The columns, with capitals in Composite order (that is with elements of both Ionic and Corinthian orders), framed a single arch which were partially removed, together with the entablature, between 1550 and 1565. The arch was finally demolished in 1662 under the orders of Pope Alexander VII, as the arch was rundown and it was a hindrance to the flow of traffic along the via del Corso. The demolition of the arch was noted in a plaque that was posted at the site in 1665. The three Hadrianic reliefs were placed at around the same time in the staircase of the Palazzo dei Conservatori (today the Capitoline Museums).", "Androcalva pearnii": "Androcalva pearnii is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae and is endemic to the Blackdown Tableland National Park in eastern Queensland.

", "Armenians of Julfa": "Julfa also called Jugha or Djulfa, a historic town located in modern-day Julfa, Azerbaijan (city), was once home to a thriving Armenian community known for their art, culture, and trade. The Armenians who lived in Julfa were primarily members of the Armenian Apostolic Church. \n\n## History\n\n The history of Julfa's Armenian community dates back to the 6th century, when Armenians first settled in the region. Over the centuries, the community grew and prospered, establishing trade connections with neighboring cities and towns and becoming known for their expertise in craftsmanship. Approximately 250,000 to 300,000 Armenians were forcibly displaced from the area between 1604 and 1605, with many dying while attempting to cross the Arax River. Most of the Armenians were eventually relocated to Iranian Azerbaijan, where they joined the Armenians who had already established themselves there. Additionally, a number of individuals were transported to areas such as Mazandaran, and urban centers like Sultanieh, Qazvin, Mashhad, Hamadan, Arak, and Shiraz. Those who were affluent and hailed from Julfa were particularly sent to Esfahan, the Safavid capital, where they were provided with preferential treatment and endured less difficulty during their relocation. The Julfa population established their settlement along the shores of the Zayandeh Rud river. They were provided with a new town, known as New Julfa (Nor Jugha), which was constructed exclusively for them in the year 1605. \n\n## Armenian cemetery in Julfa\n\n One of the most famous landmarks in Julfa was the Khachkar Cemetery, which featured thousands of intricately carved stone crosses, or khachkars, that marked the graves of Armenian residents. The cemetery was established in the 17th century and continued to be used until the deportation of the Armenian population of Julfa in 1604 by the Persian Safavid dynasty. In 2006, reports emerged that the Azerbaijani government was deliberately destroying the cemetery, sparking outrage from the Armenian diaspora and international community. In response, UNESCO designated the site as a World Heritage site in 2008, recognizing its cultural significance and calling for its protection. Vazken S. Ghougassian, writing in \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\", described the cemetery as the \"until the end of the 20th century the most visible material evidence for Julfa\u2019s glorious Armenian past.\"", "Andrei Lupa\u0219": "Andrei N.

Players have the choice of using conventional or nuclear weapons, as well as land, sea and air forces. Players can spend money on guerilla forces, political subversion, spies, transportation systems, or economic aid to neutral countries being fought over. The game comes with several proposed scenarios. Optional rules allow for a third player (taking the role of China), and a fourth player (taking the role of Nazi Germany that has somehow survived World War II.)  \n\n## Publication history\n\n In 1976, Dave Casciano designed \"Arms Race\", which was subsequently published by his company AWA (also known as Dave Casciano Co. or DCC) packaged in a ziplock bag. The self-published game was not well-received by the gaming community \u2014 in a 1980 readers poll conducted by \"Ares\" of 70 science fiction games, \"Arms Race\" placed 65th. \n\n## Reception\n\n In the 1977 book \"The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming\", Nicholas Palmer described the game as \"the USA and USSR [...] slugging it out with armour, infantry, fighters, bombers, spy satellites, U2s, guerillas, transports, subversive political groups, secret foreign services, extensive production rules, and the threat of nuclear war.\" In \"The Guide to Simulations/Games for Education and Training\", Martin Campion noted the central concept of the game \"is to build the right thing at the right time.\" However, Campion felt the game \"is a very good idea but somewhat flawed in the execution. The rules are sometimes more suggestive than explanatory, the counters are poorly printed and impossible to punch out, and the map is hard to read and aggressively ugly.\" For teachers planning to use it in the classroom, Campion suggested that they should \"be prepared to make up some rules as you go along. Also, it will be better to plan on making your own map.\"", "Arezoo Ardekani": "Arezoo M. Ardekani is an Iranian-American physicist who is a professor at Purdue University.

At the time of the crime, McLaughlin was living as male; she transitioned from male to female while incarcerated. McLaughlin became the first openly transgender person to be executed in the United States. Her legal name remained her birth name, Scott A. McLaughlin, and she was identified as such in her death warrant and in prison records. McLaughlin was a registered sex offender, due to a 1992 conviction for sexual assault against a 14 year old girl. At McLaughlin's 2006 trial, the jury deadlocked on the issue of the death penalty. In most U.S. states, this would result in a sentence of life imprisonment. However, Missouri is one of only two states (the other being Indiana) in which a judge has the discretion to sentence a defendant to death if the jury deadlocks on the issue of capital punishment. In August 2021, McLaughlin's sentence was reinstated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.", "Apaj Gutkeled": "Apaj (I) from the kindred Gutkeled (; died after 1239) was a Hungarian baron in the first third of the 13th century, who served as Ban of Slavonia from 1237 to 1239, during the reign of B\u00e9la IV of Hungary. \n\n## Family\n\n Apaj was born into the S\u00e1rv\u00e1rmonostor branch of the powerful \"gens\" (clan) Gutkeled. His parentage is unknown. His brothers were Nicholas (I) and Cs\u00e9p\u00e1n, ancestors of the Bocskai and Bacskai noble families, respectively. One of his cousins was Dragun, progenitor of the Maj\u00e1d branch. Apaj and his unidentified wife had a son Apaj (II). His branch became extinct in the 1340s. \n\n## Career\n\n Apaj was a confidant of prince Coloman, who was Duke of Slavonia from 1226. He functioned as \"isp\u00e1n\" of Somogy County between 1229 and 1234, which then belonged to the duke's province. Apaj possessed landholdings in Kri\u017eevci County (K\u00f6r\u00f6s) in the area between Legrad and Rasinja (present-day in Croatia). In the latter place he built a castle later called Apajv\u00e1ra (lit. \"Apaj's Castle). The Hungarian name of the village Apajkereszt\u00far still preserves the name of the original owner. The castle is first mentioned by contemporary sources in 1236. According to Croatian historian Baltazar Adam Kr\u010deli\u0107, Apaj handed over the fort to the Knights Templar in exchange for his spiritual salvation. Following B\u00e9la's ascension to the Hungarian throne, Apaj was appointed Ban of Slavonia sometime between 1235 and 1237. His deputy was vice-ban Jaksa Isaan, who is mentioned in this capacity throughout from 1238 to 1242. Apaj held his office at least until 1239, when he was succeeded by his brother Nicholas Gutkeled. It is likely that his death can be placed around this time, 1239 or 1240. His surviving seal from 1239 is one of the earliest rare examples in Hungary which depicts a mounted knight. His lands were inherited by his only son Apaj (II), who was also referred to as patron of the S\u00e1rv\u00e1r family monastery in 1270.

This was despite the red bloc often having success in the municipality for Danish general elections. In example, it was the municipality where the bloc received their 8th highest percentage of votes in 2019. In the 2017 election, the red bloc and blue bloc had sat in opposite electoral alliances, and only 272 votes had split the 25th seat, handing the seat to the electoral alliance of the blue bloc.

For this election, the council would increase from 25 to 29 seats, being the only municipality in the 2017 Danish local elections to change their number of seats. The result would see the Conservatives once again become the biggest party. However, for the first time in 112 years, it seemed as though they might lose the mayor's position.

Incumbent President Ali Bongo Ondimba is running for re-election. \n\n## Background\n\n The presidential election was last time held on 27 August 2016. On the day after the elections, opposition leader Jean Ping declared victory and said that he was \"waiting for the outgoing president to call to congratulate me\", although no results had been officially announced. Only the electoral commission was legally permitted to announce results, and the Minister of the Interior, Pac\u00f4me Moubelet-Boubeya, accused Ping of \"attempt[ing] to manipulate the democratic process\", while Bongo said that \"you must not sell the skin of the bear before you've killed him\". Nevertheless, Bongo's spokesman, Alain Claude Bilie By Nz\u00e9, asserted that Bongo was ahead and would be re-elected. Official results were scheduled to be announced on 30 August, but on that date it was stated that the announcement would be delayed by a few hours. Results were finally announced on 31 August, showing a narrow victory for Bongo, who won 49.8% of the vote against 48.2% for Ping. Turnout was placed at 59.5%. The opposition's representatives on the electoral commission refused to confirm the results, and they were therefore confirmed by a vote in which the opposition members abstained. Ping's supporters maintained that the mostly complete results they had independently collected showed their candidate beating Bongo by a large margin, 59% to 38%. Notably, the official results from Haut-Ogooue (the Bongo family's native province) showed Bongo receiving 95.5% of the vote on an alleged 99.9% turnout, an impossible result sparking widespread protests. Bongo, noting that the vote was close, stressed the importance of peacefully respecting this outcome. Following the announcement of official results, protests broke out in Libreville on 31 August, with attempts made to storm the election commission's offices. Police were out in force and tried to disperse the protesters. The Parliament building was set on fire later in the day. The following day, Ping claimed that the presidential guard had bombed his party's headquarters, killing two people. By 2 September at least five people had been killed in the capital and 1,000 more has been arrested. The United Nations expressed \"deep concern\" about the violence. Along with France and the United States, it called for de-escalation on both sides of the dispute and pressed for more transparent detail on the vote outcome. \n\n## Opposition call for fair elections\n\n On 12 December, the entire Gabonese opposition gathered in Libreville for the start of a series of meetings in view of the presidential and legislative election of 2023. This meeting, at the call of the National Union, brought together fifty parties, including civil society leaders. The meeting was meant to put pressure on the government to reform the electoral process, and remind the public authorities of the need for consultation with the opposition. For Paulette Missambo, president of U'N, there is urgency to reform in order to have a fair election in place. \n\n## Electoral system\n\n The President of Gabon is elected for a seven-year term in a single round of voting by plurality; whichever candidate places first is deemed elected, regardless of whether the candidate secured an absolute majority of votes. This system is thought to be a disadvantage to the fractious opposition, which would appear to have little chance of winning unless it unites behind a single candidate.

Iranian forces have been able to expand their influence in the region due to the ongoing conflict in Syria. Iran provides military assistance to the militias fighting against rebel forces in Syria while also supporting the Syrian government. Israel considers the expanding Iranian presence in Syria to be a danger to its national security and has therefore taken steps to thwart the transfer of weapons to the militias that pose a direct threat to Israel.

It was launched by a German art movement with the same name and financed by an art group called Kreis der Freunde des Bauhauses (German: Circle of Friends of the Bauhaus). It had significant effects on the Danish art magazines such as \"Kritisk Revy\" and \"Linien\". \n\n## History\n\n \"Bauhaus\" was started on 24 December 1926 when a new Bauhaus building in Dessau was opened. It targeted professional designers and those who were interested in design and contained articles supplemented with photographic prints and layouts. The magazine emphasized the democratic elements in art and design. In 1926 it featured Marcel Breuer\u2019s filmstrip which indicated a change in the tendency of the Bauhaus group towards the functionalism. In 1928 five issues of the magazine were edited by Martin Gropius and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy. Then the Swiss architect Hannes Meyer and Ern\u0151 K\u00e1llai became its editors.

Her \"Conference of the New Ideals in Education\" led to the creation of \"Gipsy Hill College\" in South London, a key part of Kingston University, that spread the ideas of Montessori education and the Dalton Plan. \n\n## Life\n\n Rennie was born 1875 in Westoe. Her parents were Isabella (born Southern) and Thomas Firth Moorhouse. Her father was a manager and an analytical chemist who killed himself while doing an experiment. Her mother took the family back to her hometown of Gateshead. In about 1887 the family moved again to Harrogate where her mother married Dr Rennie. The whole family took the new surname, while their stepfather became rich looking after his patients. Her father however suffered from the workload, so they moved to Torquay where he effectively retired. On 28 December 1908 the Messina earthquake struck and Rennie decided that she could adopt an orphan baby. She had been told that her dislocated hip meant that she would never have her own child. She went to Messina accompanied by a former governess and by persistance moved away any problems there might have been. She returned to England with a seven-month-old baby she had found in a convent in Naples. By this time her family were living in the New Forest and her parents agreed to adopt the child to ensure that no one thought she was Belle's natural daughter. Rennie took an interest not only in this child's development, but in development in general. She visited the Montessori Institute in Italy, and she decided to organise the first \"Conference of the New Ideals in Education\" to discuss these ideas in 1912. In 1914 she was at Runton for another \"Conference of the New Ideals in Education\" where she heard Lillian Daphne de Lissa who was a keynote speaker who had created the Kindergarten Union of Western Australia.\" In 1915 Rennie attended the third \"Conference of the New Ideals in Education\" in Stratford where a group including Rennie, Percy Nunn and William Mather agreed that a new teacher training facility was required. Rennie took the lead on the idea, and she persuaded the Board of Education to give accreditation to her new Gipsy Hill College. The Education Act 1918 was to extend the government's commitment to supplying nursery education. Rennie needed a new principal for the college. and she approached de Lissa who had been a keynote speaker at her Runton conference. This would lead to the \"Gipsy Hill College\" in South London, which gathered 14 well educated and mature students to pay \u00a354 a year to be the first trained in October 1917. The college, in time, became a key part of Kingston University. Rennie would lead \"Gipsy Hill College\" as chair of governors until 1945. In 1920 she went to America where she met Helen Parkhurst who was the lead for Montessori's ideas in the USA. This meeting discussed the Dalton Plan, which was named for a school in Dalton, Massachusetts. The Dalton Plan was intended to give a structure to the used of the Montessori methods for older children. The basic idea was that there should be a series of structured tasks for the child that in total contributed to a broad curriculum. Rennie became an evangelist for the approach, and she created the Dalton Association in Britain. In 1932 she published \"The Triumph of the Dalton Plan\" with the educational psychologist Charles William Kimmins.

It had fallen under Ottoman rule after they had conquered the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt in 1517. Two years after the Ottomans had attacked the Portuguese fortress of Diu in Gujarat, India, the Portuguese Governor of India, Dom Estev\u00e3o da Gama considered the moment ripe for a retaliatory campaign against the Ottomans in the Red Sea. To this effect, he set sail from Goa in January 1541 ahead of a fleet of 80 ships and 2000 soldiers. \n\n## Battle\n\n On their way to Suez, the Portuguese anchored at Massawa, and from there Dom Estev\u00e3o ordered his brother Dom Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o to proceed with a small forward flotilla to blockade the island of Suakin, on which its city stood, until he could arrive with reinforcements. Made aware of the Portuguese approach by scouts, the ruler of Suakin withdrew to the mainland with his treasure and Turkish guard, and had established a camp one league (6km) away from the coast by the time Dom Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o had arrived. Dom Estev\u00e3o arrived on February 22 with a larger naval force, and initiated talks, seeking to obtain pilots that would guide him to Suez where he planned to extract a ransom in exchange for not sacking the city. After several days of stalled negotiations, on March 8 Dom Estev\u00e3o landed 1000 men on the mainland before the sun had risen, determined to attack the camp. The Portuguese were divided in two squadrons of 500 men each, one commanded by the governor personally, flying a banner bearing the Cross of Christ, and another by his brother Dom Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o, who would proceed in the vanguard. The Portuguese reached the camp before daybreak and managed to catch its occupants by surprise, breach into its perimeter and cause havoc in their attack, killing many and causing the rest to flee. The camp was plundered and anything that could not be carried back to the fleet was set on fire.  The following day, Dom Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o sacked Suakin ahead of the entirety of the Portuguese forces, who afterwards razed the city, the soldiers tearing down the buildings. Rich spoils were recovered, including food supplies, valuable merchandise as well as hostages that were returned later in exchange for ransom. The Portuguese left Suakin on 9th or 10 March 1541.", "Bamboo (2023 film)": "Bamboo is a 2023 Indian Marathi-language drama film directed by Vishal Devrukhkar and produced by Creative Vibe Productions.

Revolutionary leader General Pancho Villa attacked the town of San Andr\u00e9s, and concluded when the American soldier of fortune, charged the federal positions and routed the enemy. 1,000 government soldiers were killed, and 400 prisoners were executed by Villa's self styled executioner, Rodolfo Fierro. \n\n## Battle\n\n Throughout the summer of 1913 Villa was at the peake of his success, winning battles against president Victoriano Huerta and his army. His infamous division of the north had a strength of almost 50,000 tough, disciplined troops, loyal only to Villa, and although Venustiano Carranza was the nominal leader of the revolt, it was Villa and his men who did most of the fighting. In short order, Villa had captured Guerrero, Bustillos, and Cras Grandes. In August 1913, Villa stationed his army outside the town of San Andr\u00e9s, and on the 26th he launched his attack. Villa dispatched the head of his bodyguard and commander of the \"Dorados\", Julio C\u00e1rdenas to lead the assault with the infantry. The fighting lasted all day and the rebels were unable to force his way into the city because of effective fire from the federal artillery, while C\u00e1rdenas was wounded and he and his men had to withdrawal to the safety of the rebel lines. In next day on the 27th, Villa ordered his machine gun detachments under the command of the American soldier of fortune, Major E.L Holmdahl. Holmdahl's men formed a firing line and began bombarding the enemy trenches, but as darkness was about to descend, and due to Villa's willingness to decisively conclude the battle, he ordered one of his famous cavalry charges. As C\u00e1rdenas had been wounded, Villa assigned Holmdahl to lead the attack. Holmdahl ordered a subordinate to command his machine guns, while he rode to the front of the column to commence the charge. The bugler sounded the charge, and as the Dorados charged into the mouths of the cannons shouting \"Viva Villa\", Holmdahl one hand on the reins, the other on his .45 caliber revolver shouted and charged the Huertistas, while his hat was shot off by a shell fragment during the charge. As the Dorados charged were nearing the trenches, Holmdahl was suddenly shot in the stomach and fell off his horse to the ground. Although Holmdahl was wounded, the cavalry reached the federal positions and quickly overran the trenches and routed the enemy from the field. The federals had lost 1,000 dead and 400 captured, as well as losing more than fifty artillery pieces, 400 Mauser rifles, 20,000 rounds of ammunition and seven railroad trains loaded with food, medical supplies, and uniforms. The glory of victory was soured with the brutal murders of captured troops. According to one of Villas wives, Luz Corral, Orozco sympathizers, had poisoned her daughter. Villa as an outraged father, cried out for vengeance and turned the prisoners over to his faithful killer, Rodolfo Fierro, who called himself a frugal executioner. Fierro lined up more than four hundred helpless prisoners in groups of three. Forcing them to hug each other back-to-front, Fierro then strode down their lines firing one shot from a high-powered pistol into each trio, fatally drilling all three bodies in a single shot. Fierro would giggle to Villa \"\"Look how much ammunition I saved\".\" \n\n## Aftermath\n\n The battle broke the back of federal forces in the stats and was a major victory for Villa and his men. Holmdahl, for his part was promoted to Colonel at only age 29, and later awarded an honorary legion of honor.

The women's movement in Algeria originated in the liberation movement from French colonialism in the 1940s, when women were mobilised in the struggle and integrated in the political system. The two pioneer women's groups were Algerian Women's Union (UFA), which was affiliated with the Algerian Communist Party (PCA), and the Association of Algerian Muslim Women (AFMA), founded in 1947 to mobilise women in support of political prisoners and their families.  The two women's groups both offered a more public role for women, which made it possible for them to leave traditional seclusion and participate in public life, but they contrasted with each other. The UFA included many women in all levels of the Algerian Communist Party, who advocated equality between men and women, both educational professional and political, while the AFMA mobilised women as well as men in the struggle against French colonialism, but expected women to step back from public life once independence from France had been won.  The 1940s gave rise to an intensified need for women to be able to gain equality, especially through the use of political parties. The UFA was largely made up of European women, not that it excluded Muslim women.  The AMA was created in 1947 aiming for women's liberation specifically concerning the imprisonments following protests on May 8th 1945. This was when Frane celebrated the end of Nazi rule while thousands of Algerians took protested in the streets of Setif and other cities to fight for Algerian independence as had been France's promise in exchange for troops in the Allied war effort peacefully claim Algeria\u2019s independence, as France had promised if they supported it in her fight against Nazism, however, Frances response was the brutal massacre of 45,000 Alegerians followed by sporadic mass killings.  This was a group of intellectual women. It was run by Mamia Chentouf and aimed to defend the \u2018biological differences between men and women and affirmed Arab Muslim culture\u2019. This is despite writings in the Quran not preventing women from \u2018carrying out work in the government or in society in general\u2019 and since then the \u2018ulama\u2019 has been quoted by Djamila Hanafi to have become \u2018the most distinctive and prominent school in Algeria's intellectual landscape\u2019 .  But exists as a result of the colonial impact of France. A significant part of the association was the publication of the L\u2019Alg\u00e9rie libre that justified that the role of women in the Arab-Muslim world could only be explored in a \u2018cultural framework free of western influence\u2019 thus highlighting the deep commitment and presence in independence. When the revolution occurred, violence against women, through torture rape arrest and execution, and the widening of support for female solidarity against colonial rule expanded across Algeria.  Before this ability to contribute in a larger way to public life, women were understood under patriarchal and colonial setup to be homemakers. They would look after large families in isolated industrialised slums  They would be illiterate, leaving behind little documentation of their experiences. They were voiceless in terms of society, politics, and culture, even after Algerian independence.  Women especially in these groups went one to contribute to the nationalist movement in Algeria under the umbrella of the \u2018women's section\u2019 of the FLN. Though its existence was only present through approximately a year between 1961-2, its unique presence is significant in its suggestion that there was a possibility that the emancipation of women could have been a very central feature of Algerian independence from France. It diverges from a rhetoric that suggests women were just passive, at the hands of men and rightfully highlights their revolutionary participation in Algerian independence. This section proposed a \u2018more radical program\u2019.  When the revolution occurred and when armed conflict broke out, the leaders of these two feminist groups joined freedom fighters.

As a Francosign language, it is related to French Sign Language as opposed to Auslan which is a Banzsl language which is related to British Sign Language. AISL was brought to Australia from Ireland in 1875 by a group of Dominican nuns (including a Deaf nun) where three schools were established and used AISL as a language of instruction. Due to oralist policies, the use of AISL was discontinued as a language of instruction in the early 1950s. There are now around 100 signers of this language, most of whom are in their early seventies and onwards, though there may be younger CODAs. \n\n## History\n\n According to the Irish Deaf Society, Irish Sign Language (or ISL) \"arose from within Deaf communities,\" \"was developed by Deaf people themselves,\" and \"has been in existence for hundreds of years.\" In 1875, a group of Dominican nuns (including a Deaf nun named Sister Gabriel Hogan) came to Australia from Ireland, bringing with them ISL. From there and the establishment of three schools, AISL was used as a language of instruction until the early 1950s.

The first schools for Deaf children were established in 1860 in both Sydney and Melbourne, however, the trajectory of BSL towards Auslan and that of ISL towards AISL differed. Indeed, it was along the Protestant/Catholic line that the languages were taught, where Protestant schools taught BSL-later-Auslan, and Catholic schools taught ISL-later-AISL. Both AISL and Auslan, however, stopped being used as languages of instruction after the disastrous Milan Congress of 1881, where by the 1950s, oralism cemented across Australia.

On the 15th, the troops moved forward, almost to the very edge of the Khankala forest and camped opposite the village of Yangi-Yurt. The Chechens were waiting for the approach of the Russians, and as soon as they appeared, frequent rifle shots rained down from the forest. The whole day there was a shootout, at dusk crowds of Chechens rushed into hand-to-hand combat, but the Nizhny Novgorod dragoons under the command of Colonel K. F. Stal successfully beat them off. By the time the troops approached, the Chechens had heavily fortified the gorge, creating rows of blockages, ditches and fences. \"In the middle of the dense forest of plane trees, in the depths of the gorge, the Chechens took a terrible, almost impregnable position.

Continuous shooting, hand-to-hand fighting, knocking, yaw of shying Cossack horses, crackling of trees, Bulgakov says in his report, made up a very striking picture for the eyes and ears and gave rise to extraordinary feelings. The attackers seemed to be in a fiery club. Slowly, step by step, the troops moved forward, showered with bullets from the front, turning their guns now to the right, then to the left to repel the Chechens, who attacked them furiously from the flanks. But following this bloody path, the soldiers took notch after notch, blockage after blockage, blockhouse after blockhouse. Stal\u2019s left column found the obstacles almost insurmountable. Knocked out of some trenches and spotted, the enemy took cover behind the stone bends of the gorge, fortified again, and again struck the attackers. The Chechens defended themselves desperately, giving, as Bulgakov put it, a pretext for the attackers to declare countless feats. Military historian P. M. Sakhno-Ustimovich wrote: The battle went on for seven hours. Finally, the detachment made its way through the forest and went to the other side of the gorge. But three more hours of heroic efforts were needed from the army for the final defeat of the enemy. Highlanders overturned at all points, retreated. \n\n## Losses\n\n As a result of a bloody battle, the Russians managed to break through the gorge. In various reports of I.V. Gudovich, Russian losses are called in the amount of 51 to 63 killed with 111 wounded, however, artillery officer Brimmer estimated Russian losses at about a thousand people. \n\n## Effects\n\n As a result of a stubborn 10-hour assault, accompanied by heavy losses on the part of the Russian army, the Khankala fortification was occupied by the 16th Jaeger Regiment, commanded by General P. G. Likhachev, later the hero of the Battle of Borodino. The commander of the Nizhny Novgorod Dragoon Regiment K. F.

This was done with reluctant cooperation from the Vichy French authorities, who had been put into position following the French defeated by Germany a few months earlier. The subsequent occupation then occurred gradually, with Japanese garrisons being stationed across Indochina which was still administered by the French. Earlier, in 1932, Plaek Phibunsongkhram, prime minister of Siam, overthrew the king and established his own military dictatorship in the country. He later renamed the country to Thailand, with plans to unify all Tai peoples, including the Lao, under one nation. Around October 1940 Thailand, sensing French weakness from the years previous events, began attacking the eastern banks of the Mekong between Vientiane and Champassak Province. This would erupt into a full Thai invasion in January 1941. After initial Thai victories their offensive stalled, and the French scored a great naval victory at Ko Chang, leading to a stalemate. The Japanese mediated a ceasefire and compelled the French colonial government to cede Champassak and Xaignabouli Province in Laos and Battambang Province in Cambodia to Thailand, ending the war. The loss of the territories was a massive blow to French prestige in Indochina. The dominant Laotian province of Luang Prabang (still being called Kingdom of Luang Phrabang) demanded sovereignty over all of Laos as compensation, a proposition headed by French-educated Crown Prince Savang Vatthana. A secret French report from March 1941 recognized nationalistic aspirations among the people of Laos, but feared the royal house of Champasak might choose to align themselves with Thailand should they become subordinate to another royal house. The territorial loss had already weakened French hold in the region. Savang Vatthana and Resident-Superior Maurice Roques signed an agreement on 21 August 1941 which attached the provinces of Xiangkhouang and Vientiane to the Kingdom of Luang Prabang, and placed the protectorate on the same footing as Cambodia and Annam. The renewed focus on Laos also brought significant modernization of the kingdoms administration and the French also said they would not object should the kingdom further extend itself southwards. Prince Phetsarath became the first prime minister while a new advisory council for King Sisavang Vong was headed by Savang Vatthana. To maintain support and expel Thai influence, Governor-General of Indochina Jean Decoux encouraged the rise of a Lao nationalist movement, the Movement for National Renovation, which sought to defend Lao territory from Thai expansion. A French report stated \"If the protectorate government does not succeed in creating an autonomous Laotian individuality\u2014at least among those who have received education\u2014then they will feel themselves increasingly attracted towards the neighboring country and this situation will create new difficulties\". More schools were built in Laos during this period than in the last 40 years and the French School of the Far East was even renamed the \"Temple for the National Idea of Laos\". The movement also published a propaganda newspaper, \"Lao Nyai\" (Great Laos) in January 1941, slamming Thai policies over the Lao people and the ceded lands while promoting a sense of identity across Laos. It ran poetry competitions that celebrated Lao culture and history, and ran columns that reintroduced the \u2018glorious lineage\u2019 of the modern Lao from the time of Lan Xang. The paper, however, was not allowed to stray outside official French policy or to become explicitly nationalistic. The paper also covered the movements of King Sisavang Vong who, emboldened by the expansion of his kingdom and of secret French assurances of further expansion, made trips to several southern cities, including Champasak, on his way to Phnom Penh in 1941. In the south of the country later in the war, the Lao-Seri movement was formed in 1944 which unlike the Movement for National Renovation was not supportive of the French and declared a \"Laos for Laotians\" policy aimed at achieving outright independence. \n\n## Establishment and downfall\n\n In 1944, the Liberation of Paris under General Charles de Gaulle occurred, and at the same time, Imperial Japanese troops were being largely defeated in the Pacific Front. In a last-minute attempt to draw support of the natives Indochinese, Japan dissolved French control over its Indochinese colonies in March 1945. Large numbers of French officials in Laos were then imprisoned or executed by the Japanese. The staunchly pro-French King Sisavang Vong was also imprisoned, and was forced by both the Japanese and Prince Phetsarath, into declaring the French protectorate over his kingdom ended, while entering the nation into the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere on 8 April 1945. Prince Phetsarath remained as Prime Minister in the newly independent puppet state. After Japan's surrender in August, King Sisavang Vong agreed with the French that he intended to have Laos resume its former status as a French colony against the urging of Prince Phetsarath, who sent a telegram to all Laotian provincial governors notifying them that the Japanese surrender did not affect Laos' status as independent and warning them to resist any foreign intervention. Phetsarath also proclaimed unification with the country and the southern Lao provinces of Indochina on 15 September, this led to the King dismissing him from his post as Prime Minister on 10 October. Prince Phetsarath and several other Lao nationalists formed the \"Lao Issara\" in the power vacuum, which took control of the government and reaffirmed the country's independence on 12 October 1945.", "Laima Vaitkunskien\u0117": "Laima Vaitkunskien\u0117 (born 13 September 1936) is a Lithuanian medieval archaeologist, who specialises in the study of burial practices.

The site belongs to the Kostoj\u010dinoski family and the complex is registered as a Cultural Heritage of North Macedonia. \n\n## Description\n\n \n\n## General description\n\n The complex consists of a water-based fulling mill (, \"vir\"), a dry-based fulling mill (, \"valavica\") and a water-based gristmill (, \"vodenica\"). All of them receive water from the Vev\u010danska River and for each building there is a separate trough for the inflow of water. The troughs are actually hollowed out trunks with an open or covered top and the water flows through them. The old original troughs have been preserved. To regulate the water, there is an obstacle called \"gje\u010dme\", which regulates the inflow, that is, the amount of water for the needs of the work of the water-powered fulling mill and the gristmill. The water-powered and dry-based fulling mill operated actively until the 1970s/80s, while the gristmill continued to operate. \n\n## Water-based fulling mill\n\n On the initiative of the owner Marjan Kostoj\u010dinoski, with his funds and funds from the Ministry of Environment, the water-based fulling mill was completely restored in 2007. It was rebuilt after the example of the old one which was in a very ruined condition. It has the appearance of an inverted cone. The opening in the ground is lined with stones \u2013 dry masonry and is called \"d\u017eis\". Here, sticks are arranged in a circle next to each other, tightened with wooden hoops, fastened in the lower part, and in the upper part rounded and with elliptical recesses for water drainage. The depth of the whirlpool is about 2.70 meters. Nowadays, as in the past, it is used for washing woolen fabrics, most commonly long pile blankets. Long wooden forks were used for spinning the fabrics, and for hanging and drying the fabrics \u2013 pegs called \"kljuka\u010di\". \n\n## Dry-based fulling mill\n\n The dry-based fulling mill (in local , \"valajca\") or as well as the water-based fulling mill was built at the beginning of the 20th century. In the beginning of the 2010s, it was in the phase of restoration. The drive part is original and consists of a spindle and on it pegs with fins called \"kutlici\", all made of wood. This part is in a very bad condition and needs to be restored. The interior processing section goes under the owners' house and has been almost entirely restored. Foams are made of wood (in the form of large jagged hammers) that are hung on the part called the old man with the help of beams that are also called needles. There is also a part made of boards called \"ple\u0161ti\" and the lower part is also made of boards \u2013 a chest where the folded wool fabric is placed for finishing, i.e. rolling with constant soaking of the fabrics with cold water. The reconstruction was made according to the example of the valavici in the village of Virovo, Demir Hisar Municipality, that is, of the type of dry-based fulling mills with a \"starec\", and not with a loom which was probably more characteristic of this region. Since 2007, restoration has been started. It remained to make a new one or to preserve and rebuild the outer part: the spindle, the peg, the balls and the metal part on which the spindle turns. The dry-based fulling mill was used for finishing the woolen \"kla\u0161na\", that is, for refining the coarse woolen fabrics. With the help of the action of water they were washed, dirt and excess grease was removed. The wool fibers spread out, the base is no longer known and the fabric becomes thick, but at the same time it acquires softness, elasticity, even shine. \n\n## Water-based grist mill\n\n The water-based grist mill was built by Boris Kostoj\u010dinoski in 1940\u20131941. It is built of stone and covered with tiles. The outer wall part was restored due to damage in 2007\u20132008. It consists of a drive and processing part. Water receives through a special trough which is narrowed at the end and is called a siphon. The stake is wooden and there are fins on it. It turns the spindle, and to stop the work of the mill, that is, on the water, there is a long wooden part called stavyalo. The inner processing part has been preserved with all the original parts: a wooden basket for placing the grain for grinding, a pestle that shakes the grain falling into the grinding stone, upper and lower millstones for grinding the grain, an old man for regulating the work on the stones, a floor of wooden boards where the flour falls, \"kutlica\" \u2013 a shovel for scooping out grain or flour. The mill continues to work today, but on a smaller scale \u2013 it grinds grain for flour or fodder for goods but only for closer people.", "Leucopogon florulentus": "Leucopogon florulentus is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia.

Such a vehicle would also be able to land and take off from the water, making it runway-independent. In February 2023, DARPA awarded contracts to two contractors to develop their own plans. One is General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI), partnering with Maritime Applied Physics Corporation; their design features a twin hull and a mid-wing, powered by twelve turboshaft engines. The other participant is Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences partnering with Leidos subsidiary Gibbs &amp; Cox and with ReconCraft; their design is a monohull with a high-wing, primarily relying on eight turbine engines. The initial Phase 1 GA-ASI group contract is for $8 million for the next six months, with an option for another 12 months potentially growing to a total of $29 million. Specifications for the craft include the ability to fly less than 100 feet from sea level to harness ground effect, but also the ability to climb as high as 10,000 feet above mean sea level. It should have a ferry range of 6,500\u00a0nm, and be able to take off and land in sea state 4, but sustain on-water operations up to sea state 5. And, it should meet the United States Department of Defense heavy lift requirements of 100+ tons. Such a craft would be similar in size and capacity to the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. DARPA is hoping for all of this with a low-cost design and construction philosophy. Final designs for Phase 1 are expected by mid-2024. The winning design will proceed to Phase 2, which includes further design, and the building and testing of a full-size prototype, which will then continue to flight-testing within roughly five years.", "Lifetime Achievement (album)": "Lifetime Achievement is the twenty-fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III, released on August 19, 2022, on Proper Records.

Regarding the album's overall positive attitude, Wainwright noted: \"There are a number of songs that would make you wonder what\u2019s happened here. It\u2019s not the usual cynical nihilist that we\u2019ve grown to love over the years. There is an optimism. The last few years have been good to me.\" After spending two years isolated in Long Island during the COVID-19 pandemic, the track \"Town &amp; Country\" details Wainwright's experiences and observations upon returning to New York City following the several lockdowns. \"Rolling Stone\" described the track as a \u201csardonic\" folk song that represented an emerging genre of songwriting called \"covid-pop\". The album's penultimate track, \"How Old is 75?\", features Wainwright musing on his forthcoming 75th birthday. Upon the album's release he noted: \"I write about being poised on a high diving board in this song.

They began to disregard some national rights, which for Albanians had vital value. \n\n## Background\n\n Kosovo was under Serb control at the outbreak of World War I. Serbia's claim to the region, conquered by its army under King Petar I Karadjordjevi (r. 1903\u20131921) in late 1912, had been recognized by the Conference of Ambassadors in London in July 1913. The closing of the border with Albania cut the northern Albanian tribes off from their traditional markets in Gjakova and Prizren, thus causing continued hostility and resistance to Serb rule. \n\n## Overview\n\n Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia in July 1914, thus precipitating World War I, and by October 1915, Bulgarian troops had occupied Prishtina, Prizren, Ka\u00e7anik, Gjilan, and Ferizaj. In the following month, Austro-Hungarian forces themselves reached Kosovo and occupied the other, northern half of the territory. With its troops routed and in a state of disarray, the Serb government, in flight with the military, gave orders on November 20, 1915, for the evacuation of the entire Serb army through the mountains of Albania to the Adriatic coast. The Great Serb Retreat, as this event is known, was an epic in itself and cost the lives of about 100,000 men, both soldiers and civilians. Very few soldiers reached the safety of Corfu alive. The Albanian population in Kosovo welcomed the Austrian-Hungarians as liberators. In December, the Austrian authorities began installing Albanians in local government and allowing them to use their language in the administration. From 1916 to 1918, they encouraged the opening of about 300 Albanian-language schools, which had been forbidden under Serbian rule. But the tables soon turned. On October 6, 1918, German and Austrian forces withdrew from Kosovo. In the following weeks, French and Italian troops, assisted by Serb guerrilla units, were in control of the whole region. By December 1918, Kosovo had returned to Serb rule, and the Albanian population paid the price, as it had in 1912\u20131913.", "Lella": "Lella is a given name and a surname.", "Kuldip Singh Sahota, Baron Sahota": "Kuldip Singh Sahota, Baron Sahota is a British Labour Councillor for Malinslee &amp; Dawley Bank on Telford and Wrekin Council, who has served as Leader of the council.

Mademoiselle Ren\u00e9 de Penarvan is living in an old ch\u00e2teau near Nantes, her only companion being the aged Abb\u00e9 Pyrmil. They are both devoted to the glories of the ancient house; and Pyrmil is writing its history, the chapters of which Ren\u00e9 illuminates with Gothic tracery and emblazonment. She is the last of her race and will not marry. But an unexpected incident alters her resolve. The Abb\u00e9 has discovered that a male heir exists,\u2014a plain, simple-hearted youth named Paul, living on the produce of his farm and about to marry a miller's daughter. To prevent such a horrible disgrace Ren\u00e9 marries him herself, somewhat against his will. She then puts a sword into his reluctant hand and sends him to La Vende\u00e9 to fight for his legitimate king. He returns wounded, and she is prouder of him than ever. But he dies, not without telling her that he no longer loves her, for she does not really love him. She is a heroine, not a woman. She was in love with a hero, a paladin, not with the artless country boy, who only desired to live at peace. Their child, whom Ren\u00e9 cannot forgive for being a girl, grows up. Her timidity, gentleness, and simple tastes, are hateful to the proud ch\u00e2telaine; and when she falls in love with a bourgeois, the mother's anger is terrible.

He graduated from Brown University in 1804 and studied law at the Litchfield Law School. He was admitted to the bar in 1808. \n\n## Legal career\n\n Williams practiced law in New Bedford with Charles Henry Warren. After 30 years in New Bedford, Williams moved to Lowell, Massachusetts, however, he stayed for only two years. In 1840 he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and opened a law office in Boston. In 1848 he moved to Worcester, Massachusetts. He retired in 1852. \n\n## Politics\n\n Williams was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1819 to 1823. In 1820 he played a large role in passing legislation to create Massachusetts' Court of Common Pleas. He was a candidate for Speaker of the House in 1822 and finished third behind Luther Lawrence and Nathaniel Silsbee. In 1827, Williams served in the Massachusetts Senate. Williams was a longtime friend and supporter of John C. Calhoun. Once Andrew Jackson's victory in the 1828 United States presidential election became certain, Williams publicly claimed Calhoun's friendship and joined the Jacksonians. After taking office, Jackson removed Russell Freeman from the office of Collector of Customs of New Bedford and, after Francis Baylies declined the job, appointed Williams to the position. During the campaign for the appointment, Williams and Freeman came to blows on the street. On February 17, 1830, Williams' nomination was rejected by the United States Senate 11 to 34. However, the following day Senator John Tyler moved that the vote be reconsidered and on March 8, 1830, he was confirmed by a vote of 26 to 20. Williams served as collector for 8 years. The New Bedford Customhouse was constructed during William's time in office. From 1844 to 1845, Williams served as collector of customs at the port of Boston.

Originally used as a patriotic slogan by nationalistic Russians, it subsequently spread in Ukraine as a mocking internet meme. \n\n## Original form of the meme\n\n According to scholar Mikhail Suslov, \"'Krymnash' arose as a serious meme as an attempt at describing reality\" in 2014 to promote the idea that Crimea must become part of Russia. In November 2015, a survey said that 52% of Russians believed \"Krymnash\" was a symbol of their country's \"pride and revival\".. In March 2016, there was an attempt to hold a rally to celebrate the anniversary of \"Krymnash\" in Moscow, but it did not occur. \n\n## Satirical meme\n\n According to Suslov, \"literally a day after the referendum, the meme was redefined in an ironic way.\" The new satirical form of \"Krymnash\" was began to be used in a satirical context to mock Russia's domestic failures in spite of the annexation. In formal writing, the phrase would be written as two words, like \"Krym nash\", but was written without spaces as \"Krymnash\" in its slogan form on the internet. Galina Sklyarevskaya, the head of a computer lexicography department at St. Petersburg University, says that this kind of hashtag-like spelling of slogans is influenced by Twitter. In the satirical incarnation of the phrase, the two words are always combined. In this ironic context, it is used as \"almost a throw-away line \u2013 \"our toilets don\u2019t work but at least Krymnash!\"\" When the phrase is still used sincerely by supporters of the annexation, it is almost always spelled out in two words with both capitalized, as \u201cKrym Nash\u201d.", "Kri\u0161t\u016ffek": "Kri\u0161t\u016ffek, Kristufek is a Czech surname.

The building retains its historic details and character, and only has a single-story addition to its rear. The structure features many gables and gable wall dormers, an element prominently featuring in Riebel's 1890s designs. The building uses a combination of smooth-dressed and rock-faced stone.

He was succeeded by his son, Matsudaira Kiyoyasu (1511-1536).", "Mantsheng Tsopo": "Mantsheng Anna \"Ouma\" Tsopo (1 September 1962 \u2013 1 January 2017) was a South African politician who represented the African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State Provincial Legislature from 1994 to 2014. Between 1994 and 2009, she served almost continuously in the Free State Executive Council and held several different portfolios, including as the Free State's inaugural Member of the Executive Council (MEC) for Local Government and Housing from 1994. After the 2009 general election, Tsopo left the Executive Council but remained in the provincial legislature, where she served as Deputy Speaker, as acting Speaker, and then, from June 2013, as Speaker. In the 2014 general election, she was elected to a seat in the National Assembly, but she resigned from Parliament several months later in October 2014. She was a teacher by profession and a regional leader in the ANC Women's League. \n\n## Early life and career\n\n Tsopo was born on 1 September 1962 in Hennenman in the former Orange Free State. She grew up in Theunissen and matriculated at Lebogang Secondary School in Welkom in 1978. After earning a diploma in pedagogics from the University of the North, she worked as a teacher at Naledi High School. She returned to Theunissen in 1988 to work as an administrator at the Masilo Town Council, where she remained until 1993. During the same period, she was active in the African National Congress (ANC), and in 1992 she was appointed as the regional secretary of the Northern Free State branch of the ANC Women's League. In 1993, she took up work full-time at the ANC's Northern Free State headquarters in Welkom. In addition to her pedagogical diploma, Tsopo later \u2013 while serving as an ANC representative \u2013 completed a bachelor's degree in management and leadership and a master's degree in public administration, both from the University of the Free State. \n\n## Political career\n\n \n\n## Provincial government (1994\u20132014)\n\n In South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994, Tsopo was elected to the inaugural Free State Provincial Legislature. She was also appointed to the Free State Executive Council by Premier Mosuioa Lekota, who named her the province's first Member of the Executive Council (MEC) for Local Government and Housing. She served in that position until 1996 and then as MEC for Sports, Arts and Culture from 1995 to 1996. In 1997, she was reappointed to the Executive Council as MEC for Social Welfare, a position which she held until the end of the legislative term in 1999; simultaneously, she served as Leader of Government Business in the legislature from 1997 to 1999. She was re-elected to her legislative seat in the 1999 general election and served as MEC for Health under Premier Winkie Direko from 1999 to 2004. Her term in the health portfolio coincided with the peak of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa and the \"Sunday Times\" later admired the speed with which she had rolled out mother-to-child transmission prevention programmes in public health facilities. Pursuant to the 2004 general election, Tsopo was elected to her third term in the provincial legislature and was re-appointed to the Executive Council by Premier Beatrice Marshoff, who appointed her as MEC for Education. While she was in that position, her husband, Sandile, was prosecuted for defrauding her department, the Free State Department of Education. The fraud concerned a large contract for the distribution of school books over a three-year period from 2001 to 2004, when Tsopo had been MEC for Health. Sandile and two others were convicted of defrauding the Department of Education of more than R360,000. In January 2007, the Bloemfontein Regional Court sentenced him to serve four years' imprisonment. He was denied leave to appeal. Tsopo denied having knowledge of fraud. During the same period, Tsopo was co-opted onto the National Executive Committee of the ANC; her term on the committee ended in 2007. In August 2007, she vacated the education portfolio to become MEC for Social Development in a reshuffle by Marshoff. In the next general election in 2009, Tsopo was re-elected to the provincial legislature, ranked 12th on the ANC's provincial party list, but she was not appointed to the Executive Council of Marshoff's successor, Premier Ace Magashule. Instead she became Deputy Speaker of the Free State Provincial Legislature. She served as acting Speaker from 2012 until June 2013, when she was formally elected as Speaker. She held that position until the end of the legislative term in May 2014. \n\n## National government (2014)\n\n In the 2014 general election, Tsopo did not stand for re-election to a fifth term in the provincial legislature, but instead was nominated for election to an ANC seat in the National Assembly, the lower house of the South African Parliament. She was ranked 116th on the ANC's national party list and secured a seat. In Parliament, she served as the ANC's committee whip in the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry. She resigned from Parliament on 1 October 2014. At the time of her death in 2017, she was a student of Ph.D. in governance and political transformation at North-West University. \n\n## Personal life and death\n\n Tsopo suffered from diabetes and was admitted to hospital in Welkom on Christmas Eve in 2016.

Notable people with the name include:", "Mary L. Langworthy": "Mary L. Langworthy (, Lewis; March 31, 1872 \u2013 January 15, 1949) was an American dramatic coach, writer, lecturer, clubwoman, and civic leader. She lived in Chicago, Illinois, where she wrote and directed patriotic and educational pageants. She also served in an executive capacity for many organizations, including president of the Illinois Congress of Mothers and Parent\u2013teacher association (beginning in 1914), and president of the Chicago Woman's Club (1924-25). \n\n## Early life and education\n\n Mary Ann Lewis was born in Alfred, New York, on March 31, 1872, the daughter of Abram Herbert and Augusta Melissa (Johnson) Lewis. The first American Lewis came from England and settled in Rhode Island. Her father was Abram Herbert Lewis, a professor of church history, and he was descended from a long line of Rhode Island Seventh Day Baptists. Through her mother, Langworthy descended from John Tanner, of pioneer stock, who came from England to Rhode Island. Langworthy grew up with a mingled heritage. Though deeply grounded in religious faith, she felt no special religious mission. Though furnished with natural eloquence, she felt no impulse to use it for sectarian causes. Her natural poetry blended with her natural practicality to make her a teacher of literature, and especially dramatic literature. She was educated in the district school of Alfred, New York, attending later the Plainfield Ladies\u2019 Seminary, Plainfield, New Jersey, where she received a teachers' certificate. After this, Langworthy did special work at Alfred College, Alfred, New York, in the study of English literature and languages. In 1894, she was in New York City at the Delsarte School of Expression under Eva Alberti for a course in dramatic expression. \n\n## Career\n\n On October 25, 1897, she married Benjamin Franklin Langworthy (1871-1952), an attorney of Chicago. They had two daughters, Frances Lewis and Marigold Lockhart. The family resided in Chicago. Langworthy was a dramatic coach and instructor in dramatics. She also wrote and directed patriotic and educational pageants. During the period of 1913-16, she wrote and directed the pageants for Independence Day, that were held in River Forest, Illinois. Other pageants included \"Plantation Memories\", \"As the Child Learns\", and \"The Soul of Man\". These were presented in the 1910s at Lewis Institute (now Illinois Institute of Technology), the Chicago Auditorium, and elsewhere. In 1921, she published the libretto for \"Elijah\", a religious opera in six scenes, being a dramatization of Mendelssohn's oratorio. As time passed, she became more interested in the lives of her pupils rather than in their dramatic performances. In Chicago, Langworthy saw the dangers threatening women in an industrial age. Though always a suffragist, as her parents had been before her, Langworthy was less concerned with votes for women than with womanliness for women. She began to lecture young women about life. She became identified with associations of teachers and parents for the preservation of the highest standards. As a lecturer, Langworthy was especially successful in public talks to young women. During the World War I, she served as Chair of Girls\u2019 Work in the Illinois Division of the Council of National Defense; Chair, Woman\u2019s Department of YWCA and the Overseas Service, Great Lake Division. She founded and directed \"The Jolly Tar\", a home club for sailors where everything was free, located near the Great Lakes Training Station. After the war, Langworthy filled similar positions of responsibility and service. These included serving as president of the Chicago Woman's Club (1924-25). She was the chair of the Department of Education of the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, and later, vice-president of the National Congress. She was the chair of girls' work in the Chicago Community Service; and a trustee of the village of Winnetka, Illinois. Langworthy served as director, Illinois League of Women Voters; vice-president, Cook County, Illinois School of Nursing; and secretary, Juvenile Protective Association. She was also a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) George Rogers Clark Chapter. In July 1924, Langworthy went with her husband to England to attend the meeting of the American Bar Association, held in London at the invitation of the English and Canadian Bar. After three weeks in England and Wales, they visited Holland, Belgium, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Tyrol, Italy, Switzerland, France and back to England, where a part of the pleasure for Mrs. Langworthy was a close observance of the functioning of these countries in the lines of sanitation, recreation, child protection and development, civic art and music, policing, housing, foods, and justice. \n\n## Personal life\n\n An effort to unite spiritual ideals with civic and practical life characterized her sisters and brother. An elder sister, a nurse, married William Logie Russell, head of the psychopathic branch of the New York Hospital. Another elder sister married a chemist, James Henry Parsons. Her widowed sister, Louise Lewis Kimball, was an educator; her younger sister, Mrs. Bennet Spencer, a lecturer. Her brother, Edwin Herbert Lewis, served as Dean of the faculty of Lewis Institute, and wrote romances that dealt with the relations of modern science and modern life. In religion, Langworthy was affiliated with Seventh Day Baptists. In politics, she was a Republican.

A skin cell from the donor wolf was inserted into the enucleated egg cell of a female beagle, whereby the somatic nucleus from the skin cell and the recipient oocyte were reconstituted into a new embryo. This method was performed in order to construct 137 new embryos. Scientists then inserted 85 of the embryos into seven different beagle surrogate mothers.

However, a knee injury forced him out of the final match, where Roscommon defeated Cork. \n\n## Managerial career\n\n After his playing career ended, McDermott became manager of the Roscommon team. It was said that: \"In Gaelic games he is a relatively new phenomenon, the 'team manager' - usually young, tracksuited, able to perform a wide range of skills, thick-skinned, a good motivator, a good communicator, a multi-talented father figure - roles which Martin 'Marty' McDermott has become very familiar with over the past few years.\"  McDermott got the team to the 1982 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship Final which was won by Donegal.

He is the author of Piel de \u00e9bano (Ebany skin, 2020) and other published historical and contemporary novels. \n\n## Biography\n\n The Colombian author, with an early vocation as a writer, studied mechanical engineering at the University of America in his hometown, with the idea of having a trade and financial stability that would allow him his passion for literature. Soon after, his family moved to Barranquilla, where he began his literary career with his first novel, \"El laberinto blanco\" (The white labyrinth, 2014), which recreates the phenomenon of drug trafficking and prostitution. It was followed in 2015 by Scarlett... La esencia divina del deseo (Scarlett... The divine essence of desire), which deals with the erotic excesses. In 2000, while working in a concrete company in Barranquilla, he emigrated to the United States, after a failed kidnapping by the guerrillas. He has spent most of his literary and professional career in the United States. \n\n## Literary development\n\n Having ventured into contemporary themes linked to current affairs, he threw himself fully into the historical novel, with the creation and publication of \"El gran genocidio. \u00bfDescubrimiento o exterminio?\" (The great genocide. Discovery or extermination? 2018). After the discovery of the sunken treasure of the San Jos\u00e9 galleon in Colombian waters, the author takes advantage of this circumstance to take a journey into the past, shifting between contemporary and historical times, and between fictional characters and others who existed historically. This is accomplished through the novel's main character, the lawyer Samuel Pirac\u00fan, a descendant of the Muiscas, who decides to sue the Spanish crown and take the matter to the International Criminal Court. The novel, published by Planeta, has been linked to Colombia's Plan Lector and raises questions about the different versions that exist about the conquest of America. The author, with ease in recreating the environments and the multiple details of the past, continued with other themes of the colonial era. Through the novel \"Piel de \u00e9bano\" (2020), he shows the times of slavery in Cartagena de Indias and the role of women. Through the mulatta Manuela, who finds her liberation through sewing, the stories of women are woven together to complete a picture that shows that misogyny, discrimination and feminicide have been part of humanity; social crimes that have been justified and that are recounted throughout the novel. The 500-page novel took six months of research, eight months of writing and eight months of revision and corrections. The research covered the study of the eighteenth century Cartagena, and among the different historiographical materials, the \"1777 Census\". Also the documents and testimonies of the illustrious travelers Antonio de Ulloa and Jorge Juan y Santacilia in 1735; documents from the General Archive of the Indies in Seville, and the General Archive of the Nation in Bogota; in addition to the advice of several Colombian historians. As for the advice on slavery, the author recognizes the importance of the novel , by the North American writer Alex Haley, to know the whole socio-economic framework of slavery between the XVI and XIX centuries. Although the novel describes the 18th century Colombian Caribbean, the narration and dialogues flow in the present, with the idea of maintaining proximity to the reader. According to Grethel Delgado, the novel is written in an \"enveloping and sensual manner, with delicate erotic scenes to reflect the carnal encounters through numerous plots that help color the colonial era with an almost palpable definition\". In \"Man in the Mirror\" (2021), he returns to the present time and the debacle of a couple after the Houston Tornado as they face death and devastation. With \"Transmigration\" (2015) and \"A Life for Steven\" (2019) the author exposes ethical and scientific debates. Robayo develops his novels by constructing a story line based on real events, knowing the ending beforehand, and incorporating the twists and turns and new plots that emerge from his imagination. The author has been present at various cultural events in Mexico, and has been invited to the Guadalajara Book Fair, the Bogot\u00e1 International Book Fair, and fairs in the United States and Ecuador.\u00a0 He has also participated in literary and historical events at several universities: U. de Cartagena, U. Surcolombiana de Neiva, and Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla, among others. In 2021 he won the 2nd Prize for best historical fiction novel at the 2021 International Latino Book Awards in Los Angeles.", "Manamansalo": "Manamansalo is the largest island in the Ouluj\u00e4rvi, the fifth largest lake in Finland.

It was first mentioned in 1555 as a part of the Liminka parish. The first church in all of Kainuu was built on Manamansalo in 1559. It became the center of the Ouluj\u00e4rvi parish, separated from Liminka on that year. The church was destroyed by Russians in 1581, after which the Ouluj\u00e4rvi parish was reintegrated into Liminka. A new church was built in Paltaniemi in 1599, after which the reestablished parish was known as Paltamo. Manamansalo remained part of Paltamo until S\u00e4r\u00e4isniemi was separated from it in 1864. The S\u00e4r\u00e4isniemi municipality was renamed Vaala in 1954 after its seat was moved from the village of S\u00e4r\u00e4isniemi to the village of Vaala. An open-air church was built on the island in 1959 in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the original church. It is located on the same site as the 16th century church. The bell of the 16th century church was found in the Solovetsky Monastery of Russia in the 1970s, having been brought there in 1596. \n\n## References\n\n    ", "Malika Abdullahodjaeva": "Malika Samatovna Abdullahodjaeva (28 November 1932 - 26 June 2018) was a Soviet and Uzbek pathologist, a full member of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, Hero of Uzbekistan (2006). \n\n## Early life and education\n\n Malika Abdullahodjaeva was born on 28 November 1932 in Moscow in a family of students of the Communist University of the Toilers of the East.

She published a number of pamphlets after her conversion. She then obtained a release for James Naylor from Exeter jail. She then proceeded with him where he entered Bristol in what was judged to be a blasphemous manner. Naylor escaped with his life, but he was given cruel punishment. \n\n## Life\n\n Calvert was baptised in 1624. Her father, George Calvert, was the vicar in Meare and her mother was Ann Collier. Her father had married once before and he had been charged with not following guidance in his ministry. Her elder brothers Giles and George, were publishers and booksellers based in the Black Spread Eagle in St Paul's Churchyard in London. Her brothers published and sold early Quaker publications including three by Martha. She had become a Quaker in 1654\u201355 and she wrote several pamphlets. In 1655 her brother published \"When the Lord Jesus Came to Jerusalem\" and \"A Lamentation for the Lost Sheep of the House of Israel\". Some time later Giles also published her work, \"O England, thy Time is Come\" in which she records two years of publically repenting in local settlements. In 1656 the second edition of her pamphlet \"Lamentation\" was published which included details of her life and her first two publications. By the end of 1655, she had married Thomas Simmonds (or Simmons) who had been a printer in Birmingham. He was known to her father and brother. She had been sent to prison after she appeared in Colchester in sackcloth and ashes and for disturbing the peace of church services. She is known for her involvement with the blasphemous James Naylor. Naylor was said to have been under a spell when he first met Martha. They spent three days together and George Fox alleged that Simmonds was a witch. Naylor was only separated from her by force by fellow Quakers. Naylor's crime was to enter Bristol on a horse, as if it was Jerusalem, accompanied by Hannah and Martha where they were met by local Quakers. They were soon arrested and Naylor was charged with blasphemy for pretending to be Jesus Christ. Her husband believed that she had been a leader in this event and more recent studies have accused Simmonds of inspiring the event. On December 27, Naylor's vicious punishment was carried out. This included having his tongue pierced with a hot spike and a \"B\" branded on his forehead. Hannah, Martha Simmonds and Dorcas Erbery were at the base of his pillory mirroring the three Marys who were at Jesus's crucifixion. She died in 1655, although the day and location are unclear.

Individuals live associated with sediment particles and suspended detritus in litoral or marine waters. It is found at marine sites all around the world. Its predominantly sedentary lifestyle was a discovery that challenged the concept of bacterivorous protists as constantly active hunters, and its permanent association with detritus particles is uncommon among flagellates. \n\n## Morphology\n\n \"M. marina\" are unicellular amoeboflagellates composed of a flattened irregular star-shaped cell body measuring 3\u20139 \u03bcm in diameter, pressed against the substrate, with several (2 to 10) thin branching filamentous pseudopodia, extrusomes close to the substrate, and two short inactive flagella that measure 4\u20136 \u03bcm. The arrangement of their pseudopodia are reminiscent of freshwater species \"Gymnophrys cometa\", which usually has only two pseudopodial trunks but more can arise. \n\n## Behavior\n\n \"M. marina\" cells often lie within detritus particles, making them difficut to see unless they are left undisturbed for several minutes. The cells frequently appear in clusters, and the pseudopodia of adjacent cells sometimes join. Electron microscopy reveals that adjacent cells in these clusters often share a common, continuous cytoplasm. \"M. marina\" are usually sedentary and feed through their pseudopodia while their flagella are inactive. However, under adverse conditions, they switch to a swimming non-feeding phase: the pseudopodia are reabsorbed and the flagella become active, with one flagellum directed forward while the other trails behind. \n\n## Distribution\n\n \"M. marina\" is extremely widespread and abundant. It has been isolated with great frequency from littoral, oceanic and deep waters from tropical and temperate regions. It has been found in \"Halophila\" beds in Fiji, Queensland, Panama, Hawaii, Rio de Janeiro, United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, and in sedimenting detritus at oceanic sites.", "Mar\u00eda Cristina P\u00e9rez Naranjo": "Maria Cristina Perez Naranjo (born April 11, 1965 M\u00e1laga) is a wheelchair fencing athlete from Spain.

As a youth, Melton experienced bouts of severe muscle and joint pain and it was recommended that he move to a warmer climate. Haynes traveled to Florida in 1845 with his younger brother Bunberry. They settled in what is now Leesburg, Florida on a bluff across Lake Astatula, naming their settlement Haynes Point.

The population in 2016 was 119 people. The village of Maksymivka is located 50\u00a0km east of Mykolaiv, 45\u00a0km west of Snihurivka.The body of local self-government is Kyselivka village council. \n\n## History\n\n \n\n## Twentieth Century\n\n At the beginning of the twentieth century, Maksymivka had 669 inhabitants. \n\n## Soviet Era\n\n In 1923, Maksymivka already had 132 yards and 650 inhabitants, including 311 children under 16 years old.In the early 20s, the village became the center of the Maksymivka village council, which, in addition to Maksymivka, included the villages of Kyselivka and Burkhanivka. The New Economic Policy (NEP) gave impetus to new rural growth. Already in 1926, on October 1, 809 inhabitants lived in Maksimovka. This is the largest number of inhabitants in the history of the village. In 1923, there was one labor school in the village, \"in which 20 boys and 21 girls studied as one teacher.\" \u00a0Parents raised funds for the renovation of this school. As evidenced by the protocol of the \"General meeting of citizens of the village of Maksimovka from September 20, 1924\". \u00a0At the same time, the Presidium of the Maksymivska village council decided to open schools for the elimination of illiteracy in each settlement that is part of the Maksymivska village council from October 1, 1924. The Nepiv period ended, and Stalin's collectivization of the village began. Maksimov peasants first organized on September 29, 1929, a TOZ called \"Shevchenko's Testament\". And already in 1931, a collective farm named after Lenin was organized, which included peasants from the villages of Kiselivka and Maksimovka. The collective farmers of the village of Maksymivka survived the terrible tragedy of the Holodomor of 1932\u20131933. Maria Petrovna Moiseenko recalls: \"in order to survive, they went to steal corn, and then they ground it on millstones and cooked porridge. In the summer we went to the field, shake up the straw, suddenly the grain falls out. We had to eat dead animals. In those years, many people starved to death.\" Shvets Evdokia Gerasimovna said that \"We went to the hamlet, exchanged earrings and wedding rings for products. People on the way fell and died because they were hungry. ate sugar and fodder beets.\" Tkachenko Elena Alexandrovna (born in 1905): \"In order not to die of hunger, they ate nuts, drums, dogs, hedgehogs, beets. They collected seeds from the birch tree, ground them on millstones, and then baked cakes.\" There is no exact data on the number of deaths in those years. \n\n## Nazi Occupation\n\n On March 13\u201314, 1944, retreating under the onslaught of the Soviet army, the Nazis shot and then burned 68 villagers. Here is what Maria Petrovna, a teacher of the Maksymivska school, who witnessed these events, told about this: \"On March 10, the Germans began to expel people from Maksymivka. At 10 o'clock in the morning, a German tank approached from the direction of Kyselivka and fired three shots at Maksimovka. A group of fascists in the village, after that began to expel all residents from the village. People took carts, packed some things and walked towards Kherson. Not far from the village there was a skyrta above the road. All the exiles stopped at the hermitage. In the distance, in the direction of the third department of the state farm \"Krasnoye Znamya\" (now the village of Vasylky), several horsemen appeared. Everyone was looking forward: who is it? Germans or ours? Finally, we recognized \u2014 this is our cavalry reconnaissance. They rushed to the Soviet soldiers, hugged them, kissed them, grabbed them by the stirrups.

This meant that any woman preacher who married a man from outside her circuit had to give up that role. Porteous however was considered to be an exceptional case and she was given special permission to continue despite the ruling. Porteous moved frequently from circuit to circuit.

Over half of the women itinerant preachers had stopped their work by 1837. The job was difficult and when they married each other then the woman was frequently the one to care for the resulting children.

(SPI) in 1975 that simulates battles during the Late Medieval period and Renaissance. Originally published by SPI as \"Renaissance of Infantry\", the game was revised and republished with the title \"Yeoman\" as part of a collection of games called \"PRESTAGS\" (\"Pre-Seventeenth Century Tactical Game System\"). \n\n## Description\n\n \"Yeoman\" is a two-player tactical board wargame in which one player controls a force such as the English at Agincourt, the Scottish at Falkirk, or the French at Courtrai, and the other player controls the force that met them in battle. Eighteen scenarios are outlined, including the battles of Crecy, Legnano, and Benevento. The game system used by all games of the \"PRESTAGS\" series is a simple \"I Go, You Go\" system of alternating turns where one player fires missiles (arrows, javelins, etc.), moves and attacks, followed by the other player. More complexity can be added by using optional rules for panic, leadership, facing, melee and simultaneous movement. In addition to the \"PRESTAGS\" rules, \"Yeoman\" also has rules unique to the period, including forming a square formation, ferocity of certain warriors, chivalric knights (must attack if the enemy is in sight), and longbowmen. \n\n## Publication history\n\n In 1970, SPI game designer Albert A. Nofi created a game that was set in the late Medieval period. Nofi's game was included as a pull-out game titled \"Tactical Game 13\" in Issue 22 of SPI's house magazine, \"Strategy &amp; Tactics\" (August 1970). Later the same year, the game was released as a boxed set titled \"Renaissance of Infantry\", and included twenty different scenarios.  At the same time, SPI also published four other games by various designers set in ancient or Medieval history. In 1975, SPI decided to gather these five disparate games together under the name \"PRESTAGS\" (\"Pre-Seventeenth Century Tactical Game System\"), and tasked John Young with creating a single set of rules that all the \"PRESTAGS\" games would use. One of the games converted to the new system was \"Renaissance of Infantry\", retitled \"Yeoman\". (The other \"PRESTAGS\" games are ', ', \"\", and \"Viking\".) The new game \"Yeoman\" replaced seven of the scenarios in the previous game with five new ones, leaving a total of 18 scenarios. \"Yeoman\" was published as a single game in 1975 and immediately moved into SPI's Top Ten Bestseller List at #9. \"Yeoman\" was also published with the other four games as \"PRESTAGS Master-Pack\". \n\n## Reception\n\n In a 1976 poll conducted by SPI to determine the most popular board wargames in North America, \"Yeoman\" was rated at 44th out of 202 games. In the January 1976 edition of \"Airfix Magazine\", Bruce Quarrie noted \"these rules allow a wide degree of flexibility in approach to the game. It can be an absolutely basic and 'unrealistic' affair [...] or by addition of optional Panic, Facing and Melee rules, and a [simultaneous movement sequence, it reproduces quite accurately the true conditions of the time.\" He concluded, \"In general [...] the result is as SPI intended, to satisfy both those who desire a simple format and those who can assimilate relatively complex restrictions.\"  In his 1977 book \"The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming\", Nicky Palmer thought the special rules for \"Yeoman\" \u2014 \"squares, foolhardy cavalry, longbowmen, trenches, cavalry traps and artillery limbering\" \u2014 gave the game a \"fair 'period' feel.\" In \"The Guide to Simulations/Games for Education and Training\", Martin Campion noted the changes from \"Renaissance of Infantry\" to \"Yeoman\", saying, \"The rules are somewhat simplified although the standard rules for the [\"PRESTAGS\"] series are considerably modified by the special rules for \"Yeoman\". The scenarios, when kept, are improved [...] The change to these games from their predecessors was generally a happy one, but sometimes some of the flavor of the individual periods was lost in the process.\" In the 1980 book \"The Complete Book of Wargames\", game designer Jon Freeman commented, \"\"Yeoman\" is a bit more complex than the others in the [\"PRESTAGS\"] system because combat became more complicated with the introduction of gunpowder.\" Freeman gave this game an Overall Evaluation of \"Good\".", "\u00dc\u00e7direk, Ad\u0131yaman": "\u00dc\u00e7direk () is a village in the Ad\u0131yaman District, Ad\u0131yaman Province, Turkey.

She also served as Provincial Treasurer of the ANC's Northern Cape branch from June 2008 until her death.  At the time of her death, Botha \u2013 along with John Block and Alvin Botes \u2013 was facing criminal charges in connection with her relationship to a private company, Trifecta Investment Holdings. Before her election to Parliament, from 2001 to 2009, Botha was head of the Northern Cape's provincial Department of Social Development, which had granted sizeable contracts to Trifecta. In 2011, Parliament's Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests had reprimanded Botha for having failed to disclose benefits that she had received from Trifecta; and, in 2013, the National Prosecuting Authority indicted her on fraud and money laundering charges, alleging that she had received illegal kickbacks from the company.  \n\n## Life and career\n\n Botha matriculated in Upington in the former Cape Province in 1964. She held a bachelor's degree from the University of the Western Cape, completed in 1988. Between 2001 and 2009, Botha was head of the Department of Social Development in the Northern Cape Provincial Government. At the same time, she was a member of the governing party, the ANC, and in August 2008, at a provincial party elective conference in Moshaweng, she was elected Provincial Treasurer of the ANC's Northern Cape branch, serving under Provincial Chairperson John Block. The following year, Botha stood as a candidate in the 2009 general election and secured election to an ANC seat in the National Assembly, the lower house of the South African Parliament. She chaired Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Social Development.  Botha was re-elected as ANC Provincial Treasurer, unopposed, in June 2012. She was also re-elected to a second term in her legislative seat in the 2014 general election, ranked fifth on the ANC's provincial-to-national party list for the Northern Cape. \n\n## Relationship with Trifecta Holdings\n\n \n\n## Parliamentary ethics probe: 2011\n\n Soon into the legislative term, Botha was charged with misconduct in Parliament's Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests. The investigation emanated from investigating reporting by the \"Mail &amp; Guardian\" which purported to uncover that Botha had received kickbacks from Trifecta Investment Holdings, a company which had signed property leases worth more than R50-million with the Northern Cape Department of Social Development. The leases were concluded during Botha's tenure as head of department, and the \"Mail &amp; Guardian\" alleged that Trifecta had offered Botha a 10% stake in the company and had paid to renovate her home in 2009. Botha denied that her relationship with Trifecta was corrupt or otherwise inappropriate. She said that the stake in the company had been vested in her relatives and that the home renovation was financed with a loan which she would repay to Trifecta. In August 2011, the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests found Botha guilty of breaching the parliamentary rules for failing to disclose the benefits she had received from Trifecta. It also found her guilty of \"wilfully misleading Parliament\" about the scale of the loan she had received from Trifecta \u2013 she had said under oath that it was worth R500,000, when in fact the renovation costs exceeded R1.2 million. She was sentenced to the maximum penalty: a reprimand and a fine of 30 days' salary. \n\n## Criminal charges: 2013\u20132014\n\n In 2013, Botha was indicted on criminal charges in connection with kickbacks allegedly received from Trifecta. Her co-accused included two other Northern Cape politicians, John Block and Alvin Botes, as well as other Northern Cape officials. The National Prosecuting Authority alleged that Botha, Block, and Botes had been given kickbacks in exchange for encouraging the provincial government to sign leases with Trifecta at grossly inflated rates. All pled not guilty on charges of fraud, corruption, and money laundering. The trial was ongoing when Botha died in December 2014, but Block was later found guilty of corruption and money laundering, as was Trifecta's former chief executive, Christo Scholtz; Botes was acquitted. \n\n## Death and estate\n\n In November 2014, Botha's doctor told the Northern Cape High Court that she was terminally ill. She was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma, which spread to her brain, and she died on 28 December 2014 in a hospital in Kimberley. After Botha's death, her family entered into a prolonged dispute with the state over the proceeds of her estate, which the National Prosecuting Authority argued constituted proceeds of unlawful activities in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. In 2016, the Northern Cape High Court ordered that Botha's family should forfeit both her home and the Trifecta shares she had been given. After a series of appeals, the dispute was heard in the Constitutional Court, which in March 2020 decided in favour of the state, ruling that the estate should forfeit the full value of the Trifecta-funded renovations.", "\u00c7aml\u0131k, Bucak": "\u00c7aml\u0131k is a village in the Bucak District of Burdur Province in Turkey.

YOU have what it takes!\u201d\"", "Yu Takeuchi": " (Tokyo, 16 March 1927 - Bogot\u00e1, 25 December 2014) was a Colombian nationalized Japanese physicist and mathematician, teacher and promoter of mathematics in Colombia. \n\n## Biography\n\n Takeuchi studied theoretical physics at the Imperial University of Tokyo (now University of Tokyo) and was a professor at the Ibaraki University. He arrived in Colombia through a cultural exchange program sponsored by the National University of Colombia and the Japanese government in 1959, and he would go on to teach at the university until 1989. Along with five other Japanese professors, Takeuchi arrived in Colombia, entering through Buenaventura, without knowing how to speak Spanish. The hiring process was arranged by the Japanese embassy. His selection was made from a pool of 30 teachers, as Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00eda Piment indicated in an interview with UN Radio. Although Takeuchi graduated as a physicist due to family influence, his interest was to learn and teach mathematics. He taught courses on vector analysis, calculus, and sequences, with the latter being his main interest. He is known for being the founder of the magazine \"Matem\u00e1ticas: Ense\u00f1anza Universitaria\" and was part of the first class of the master's degree in mathematics at the National University of Colombia in 1972. According to Ignacio Mantilla, a former student of Yu Takeuchi and former rector of the National University of Colombia, in the event commemorating 100 years of relations between Colombia and Japan in 2008, Takeuchi was recognized as the most influential Japanese figure in Colombia. Since 2016, the Takeuchi family and the Colombian Academy of Exact, Physical, and Natural Sciences have awarded the Yu Takeuchi Prize in honor and memory of him. \n\n## Work as a Educator\n\n Since he started working as a teacher in Colombia, Takeuchi became very aware of the backwardness and lack of updating of mathematics in the country and the need to train teachers at all levels of education. Therefore, he also dedicated himself to traveling throughout the national territory, disseminating Modern Mathematics through seminars, workshops, and collaborations of all kinds. \n\n## Printing press\n\n By the 1960s, many students at the Faculty of Sciences of the National University of Colombia did not have the economic resources to acquire textbooks, few of which were in Spanish. Takeuchi knew of this difficulty, so he had a printing press in the garage of his house, where with the collaboration of his wife and children, he produced various hand-made and low-cost texts that were easily accessible to the university community. According to the professor, his greatest desire was to transmit mathematical knowledge at all costs, which Colombia lacked in those years. Iv\u00e1n Castro Chadid, a close colleague of Takeuchi, remembers: &lt;blockquote&gt;Actually, this was what he did with his publications as he himself stated: \"I wrote texts for everyone, seeking the popularization of mathematics.\" Usually, these books were made up of 60 paragraphs, so that each paragraph corresponds to a one-hour lesson, adapted to the teaching of a subject over a whole semester. The criterion that guided him, according to his own words, was the following: \"Today, when time seems to be getting shorter and research fields are becoming ever larger, practical books that are economically within everyone's reach, of good academic level, and with topics selected with the future in mind, that truly help the student, are necessary. I present texts that meet these conditions and needs.\"&lt;/blockquote&gt; \n\n## Recognitions\n\n Among the most important distinctions received by Professor Takeuchi are the following: In 2008, Takeuchi was awarded the Medal of the Order of San Carlos and the Medal of the Order of the Sacred Treasure by Colombia and Japan respectively, for his achievements in mathematical education. In 2010, he became a Colombian national.", "Zden\u011bk \u010ce\u0161ka": "Zden\u011bk \u010ceska (6 February 1929 \u2013 14 January 2023) was a Czech academic, lawyer, and politician.

According to some beliefs, zuhris possess physical and supernatural traits that distinguish them from normal children, and make their blood valuable and sought after for various magical rituals, especially the hunt for old treasures, believed to be hidden or protected by the djinn. While such superstitions have mostly disappeared in Morocco, or are not taken as seriously as in the past, several instances of violence, kidnapping and even murder of children in Morocco, may be related to attempts at finding hidden treasures using \"zuhri\" children. They may be subject to kidnapping by human traffickers, to be resold at a hefty price to treasure hunters. \n\n## Etymology\n\n The term \"zuhri\" may find its origin in the Moroccan Darija word \"zher\" meaning \"luck\", or it may have derived from \"Zohar\", the name of a book of Kabbalah. \n\n## Traits and origin of a Zuhri\n\n Children believed to be zuhri can have some or all of these physical traits: A zuhri is believed to be either a djinn offspring who was swapped with a human newborn at birth, or a human child who has supernatural abilities, possibly due to being possessed by a djinn from birth. \n\n## Rituals\n\n According to Ahmed Amlik, professor of History at Cadi Ayyad Universiry of Marrakech, people in the past tended to bury their personal or family valuables at hidden locations in forests, or in deep wells, usually during times of turmoil and civil war. Zuhri children are thought to possess psychic abilities or connection to the world of djinns, that can help with finding the hidden treasures buried at those locations, and are therefore used like \"magical treasure detectors\". The ritual of finding the treasure may involve the recitation of Koranic verses, as well as spilling the blood of the zuhri child. The zuhri may also help with carrying the treasure, since he or she is believed to be less likely to be punished by the djins for stealing their possession. The ritual may end by sacrificing the child and spilling their blood on the treasure, to appease the anger of the djins. In some cases the child is simply abandoned between life and death.", "Zombis": "Zombis is a monotypic genus of Galeodid camel spiders, first described by Eug\u00e8ne Simon in 1882.

University of Colorado": "Lisa Simpson; Anne Gilmore v. University of Colorado Boulder, Nos. 06-1184 and 07-1182 (Sept. 6, 2007) was a case in which the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that there was enough evidence that the University of Colorado Boulder was deliberately indifferent under Title IX of not taking appropriate measures to limit sexual assault on their campus despite officials, such as Gary Barnett, having a general knowledge of the harassment and the risk of sexual assault occurring. \n\n## Background\n\n The case involved a female student, Lisa Simpson, who was allegedly sexually assaulted by a male student, in 2001 while they were both attending the University of Colorado Boulder. Simpson reported the assault to the university, which investigated and found the man responsible for sexual misconduct. However, the university did not take any disciplinary action against him and allowed him to continue attending classes with Simpson. Simpson eventually sued the university, alleging that it had violated her rights under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in education. After the case was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn an appeal sent the case to trial in 2004, and the jury found the university liable for failing to adequately respond to Simpson's allegations of sexual assault. The jury awarded Simpson $2.5 million in damages, including $1 million in punitive damages. The case raised important questions about the responsibilities of universities in preventing and responding to sexual assault on campus, especially universities that receive federal funding as the impact of this case made the influence of Title IX bigger than what most schools expected. It highlighted the need for universities to take a proactive approach to addressing sexual assault, including educating students about consent, providing support to victims, and holding perpetrators accountable. \n\n## Opinion of The Court\n\n The district court made the decision based off the evidence in this case that at the time of the assaults on the plaintiffs: \"(1) Coach Barnett, whose rank in the CU hierarchy was comparable to that of a police chief in a municipal government, had general knowledge of the serious risk of sexual harassment and assault during college-football recruiting efforts; \u2009(2) Barnett knew that such assaults had indeed occurred during CU recruiting visits; \u2009(3) Barnett nevertheless maintained an unsupervised player-host program to show high-school recruits \u201ca good time\u201d; \u2009and (4) Barnett knew, both because of incidents reported to him and because of his own unsupportive attitude, that there had been no change in atmosphere since 1997 (when the prior assault occurred) that would make such misconduct less likely in 2001\". With these findings the court also found that a jury would find that the need for new training was so obvious that Barnett could be found deliberately indifferent of the need to do so. \n\n## Deliberate Indifference\n\n Deliberate indifference is a legal term that describes an official knowing about a potential source of harm occurring and taking no action to help a person they are responsible for from that harm. Deliberate Indifference was initially defined in a United States Supreme Court Case Estelle v Gamble. In Estelle v Gamble deliberate indifference was used in a prison to prisoner relationship as a prisoner did not receive medical attention that was needed, and the prison was deliberately indifferent to his needs. Another case that is relevant to the topic of deliberate indifference is another Supreme Court case Farmer v Brennan. Farmer v Brennan was another prison-based case in which a trans woman was placed in an all-male prison and was subsequently raped. The court ruled that the prison was deliberately indifferent to this fact and the case was seen as influential because it was the first time the Supreme Court had addressed sexual assault in prison. \n\n## Impact\n\n With the decision by the court of appeals a grand jury investigation was prompted and as a result an indictment was made with a former recruiting aid being sentenced to probation after pleading guilty, also the University of Colorado's athletic department faced an overhaul as the resignations of both the Athletic Director and CU system president quickly followed the indictment. The settlement that was reached with Simpson also provided a new advisor independent of the University to monitor Title IX compliance and an additional part-time counselor who will work in CU's Office of Victim's Assistance. The Tenth Circuit sent a message through this case to universities that female students can be harmed when a university is deliberately indifferent and that a university and its officials can be held accountable.", "Sheeshram Singh Ravi": "Sheeshram Singh Ravi is an Indian politician who served as Member of 13th Lok Sabha from Bijnor Lok Sabha constituency from 1999 to 2004.

After responding to an unrelated disturbance, Brennand saw Cantu eating a hamburger in his vehicle, and recognized the vehicle as the same one which had evaded him at a traffic stop the day prior. After opening Cantu's driver-side door, Brennand opened fire when Cantu reversed the vehicle and the same door struck Brennand. Brennand was fired less than a week later and was later charged with two counts of aggravated assault by a peace officer. He was later indicted for aggravated assault and attempted murder. Following the incident, Cantu was immediately placed on life support and remained hospitalized for a number of weeks. \n\n## Background\n\n Brennand was a probationary officer who had been with the SAPD for seven months prior to the shooting. The day prior to the shooting, Cantu had evaded police in the same maroon vehicle, with license plates that were not registered to it. Whether or not Cantu was the same individual from the incident the day before was initially unclear, with some media outlets reporting that Cantu was not the same individual. For example, ABC News reported that officer Brennand had \"confus[ed] him and his car with someone who fled from an attempted stop the night before.\" The San Antonio Current later reported that Cantu apparently was the same individual, based on police records of an interview with Cantu's girlfriend. Cantu's girlfriend was in the car with him during both incidents, and the first incident left her hesitant to get in the car with him again for fear that Cantu's actions might get them arrested or \"shot at,\" she stated in that interview. \n\n## Shooting\n\n Around 10:45 PM on October 2, Officer Brennand responded to the McDonald's on Blanco Road in San Antonio for an unrelated disturbance call. As he questioned witnesses, Brennand noticed Cantu's vehicle, which had evaded him the day before. The vehicle had license plates registered to another vehicle, making Brennand think it was stolen. After Brennand called for backup, he approached the vehicle, opened the driver-side door, and ordered Cantu to exit. As Cantu reversed his vehicle, the open door hit Brennand, who fired five times. He then fired five more times as the vehicle drove away. A passenger sitting in the vehicle was uninjured. Police later stated that while the vehicle had license plates registered to another vehicle, it was not stolen. Cantu was rendered unconscious and put on life support as a result of the shooting. An attorney for the family said that, \"any reports that Cantu is stable or is 'going to be fine' are not true.\" On October 25, 2022, the family gave a press conference, where they stated that Cantu had developed pneumonia. In addition, the family stated that three of the bullets had been removed, but not a fourth, located near his heart. Cantu's father stated that his condition was \"touch and go.\" On November 7, Cantu's family stated he was weaned off life support and was placed on high-flow oxygen via a tracheostomy. On November 22, Cantu was released from the hospital and returned home. \n\n## Reaction\n\n The Party for Socialism and Liberation and ACT 4 SA held a protest on October 11 outside the SAPD headquarters. Cantu's family hired civil rights lawyer Ben Crump. Cantu's girlfriend also hired Crump. \n\n## Investigation and charges\n\n Two days after the shooting, Brennand was fired. A spokesperson for the SAPD said Brennand violated his training and police procedures, citing how he approached the vehicle before backup arrived. On October 11, Brennand was charged with two counts of aggravated assault by a peace officer, one count for Cantu and another for the uninjured passenger. SAPD Police Chief William McManus stated that if Cantu died, the charges could have been upgraded to homicide. Brennand was released on a $200,000 bail. His pre-hearing was set for November 23, 2022. He was later indicted by a grand jury for aggravated assault and attempted murder.

Sponsored by the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools for Negroes (ACSSN) and funded by the General Education Board(GEB), the study began in the year 1940 under the direction of William A. Robinson and officially ended in 1946. As the supervisor of North Carolina\u2019s black secondary schools, Robinson presented information on progressive education in regard to the black community at the 1937 ACSSN conference. This specific presentation titled, \u201cProgressive Education and the Negro\u201d was a catalyst for progressive techniques that laid the foundation for this study.  The purpose of the Secondary School Study was to further explore new and innovative high school curricula in a way that fit the black youth of this time, especially those not considering post-secondary education. Similar to the Eight-Year Study which was a precursor to the Secondary School Study, it questions what was necessary to increase the curriculum for black schools. Historically, progressive African American education had remained relatively stagnant. Without a clear direction of how progressive education would manifest itself within the school system, progressive African American educators began cultivating practices they found most crucial to the success of students in this time period. Some of these important aspects include cooperation and experimentation to adapt previous curricula to best fit their ideas of progressive education. For the experiment, seventeen schools titled \u201cmember schools\u201d (which are the sites where the experiments were conducted) were chosen from America\u2019s Southeast to conduct this experiment in which they attempted to reconstruct their curriculum and teaching programs. \n\n## Design\n\n The parameter under which the Secondary School Study was conducted involved seventeen chosen high schools within the span of a decade. Within this period, each of these member schools began implementing their ideas of what progressive education would look like. The study did not provide a set of standards by which progressive education would be controlled or taught, just that it was a shift from traditional curricula to a more integrated mode of teaching. Thus, progressive education was more of a fluid term and specific teachers took their own liberties and ideologies to interpret what that looked like in their particular classroom. This progressive educational pursuit was implemented through programs both curricular and extracurricular based, as well as various other activities. Through these lessons and activities, African American educators were able to also create an environment for students to learn about social justice as well as social activism. \n\n## Effect\n\n Contradictory to the predecessor of the Eight-Year Study, the Secondary School Study did not conduct follow-up research. The study concluded in 1946, and experimental work in interpretations of progressive education continued in various locations in the Southeast as well as throughout the country. This study concludes that the importance comes from the work of the teachers, the black progressive educators involved in the development of a new form of education received by the students during this period in the Jim Crow era. There was no set definition of what progressive education would appear to look like, so the different interpretations from black educators allowed evolving ideas to fit their student\u2019s needs.", "Sijiqing, Beijing": "Sijiqing Area () is an area and a town on southern Haidian District, Beijing, China.

The genus contains a single species, L. platypelvis, known from a partial skeleton. \n\n## Discovery and naming\n\n The holotype specimen, NMS.Z.2021.40.37, was discovered in 1995 by Michael Daniels in layers of the London Clay Formation (Walton Member), dated to the early Ypresian, which is located near Walton-on-the-Naze in Essex, England. This specimen consists of some thoracic vertebrae, the pygostyle, the majority of the pectoral girdle, a partial right humerus, partial ulnae, partial carpometacarpi, carpal bones, wing phalanges, a partial pelvis, a right tarsometatarsus, and several pedal phalanges. In 2022, German paleontologist Gerald Mayr and British zoologist Andrew C. Kitchener described \"Lutavis platypelvis\", a new genus and species of bird, based on these fossil remains. The generic name, \"Lutavis\", combines the Latin words \"lutum\", meaning \"mud\" or \"clay\", in reference to the discovery of the fossil in the London Clay Formation, and \"avis\", meaning \"bird\". The specific name, \"platypelvis\", combines the Greek word \"\u03c0\u03bb\u1fb0\u03c4\u1fe0\u0301\u03c2\u201d (\u201dplat\u00fas\u201d), meaning \u201dwide\u201d, with \u201cpelvis\u201d, in reference to the taxon's wide, shallow pelvis. \n\n## Description\n\n Although the tarsometatarsus of \"Lutavis\" shares some similarities with those of the extinct \"Plesiocathartes\" and \"Paracrax\", the remainder of the skeleton is significantly different, with very few similarities. Preserved fossilized toe pad integument was observed on a piece of matrix collected with a pedal phalanx. A similar instance was seen in the holotype of the contemporary \"Ypresiglaux michaeldanielsi\". \"Lutavis\" had relatively short legs compared to other birds. Although the tuberculum dorsale of the humerus is small (while it is large in extant birds capable of sudden take-offs), the coracoid is especially large, suggesting that \"Lutavis\" was capable of well-developed flight. \n\n## Classification\n\n Mayr and Kitchener (2022) could not confidently place \"Lutavis\" within any avian clade due to the lack of derived features in the holotype. They suggested that an assignment to the Leptosomiformes would be possible but highly speculative, and that future work should be done to establish a more confident placement.", "Lonchegaster": "Lonchegaster is a genus of flies in the family Stratiomyidae. \n\n## Distribution\n\n Australia.", "Luzelle Adams": "Luzelle Henrietta Adams is a South African lawyer and politician who represented the Congress of the People (COPE) in the National Assembly from 2009 until 2014, when she failed to gain re-election.

The film's original title is \"Hotel Leikeu\" (\ud638\ud154 \ub808\uc774\ud06c). \n\n## Plot\n\n Yoo-mi's father passed away many years ago. Since then, she and her younger sister have lived with their widowed mother in a tiny house that they inherited. But soon the poor family suffers a new loss: their mother dies under tragic circumstances, and now Yoo-mi has to take care of her younger sister.

The old friend owns a cozy hotel by the lake, and the girls visited the place in the childhood to enjoy the pristine nature. But, arriving at the hotel, Yoo-mi begins to suffer from a bad feeling and decides to stay overnight. Next morning, the younger sister disappears without a trace. Now, the older sister has to find her. \n\n## Reception\n\n Lindsay Traves of \"CGMagazine\" wrote, \"Though \"Lingering\" has a few too many rising actions to feel focused, it\u2019s ultimately a beautiful film. It does well with the Korean horror tradition of family focused stories and fear arising from familial relationships. The appearance of the simple scenes is certainly it\u2019s strength in the creation of scares\". Don Anelli of \"Asian Movie Pulse\" stated, \"Overall, \u201cLingering\u201d manages to get quite a lot right. One of its better aspects is director Yoon-een's ability to offer up a heartwarming story at the center between Yoo-mi and Ji-yoo. Doing the journey as a favor for her friend, the bond that develops, as a result, is impressively handled. Yoon-een makes it so it's quite possible to believe they are related through the interactions and protective nature that forms here..Once we're aware of the protective and motherly focus at the center of the film, the slow emergence of the horror elements towards Ji-yoo become all the more frightening.\"", "Lucknow Super Giants in 2023": "Lucknow Super Giants is a franchise cricket team based in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.

She rescued the Society of Saint Margaret in Hackney after many of the nuns left to become Roman Catholics. \n\n## Life\n\n Warburton was born in Warburton, Cheshire. She was the first child of Anne (born Stone) and James Francis Egerton-Warburton. Her Oxford-educated father was a Church of England priest. He became rector of Lymm cum Warburton in 1832. Her father died while she was still a child in 1849. She took religious guidance from her cousin, the poet, Rowland Egerton-Warburton. Rowland was a religious man with his own private chapel at Arley Hall. A choir would sing Matins every day, his staff would attend, and he would appear even if it was in his hunting attire. When she was eighteen she wanted to join Elizabeth Neale at the Community of the Holy Cross, but her cousin's chaplain Charles Gutch recommended that she join the Society of Saint Margaret which had been founded in 1855 by Elizabeth Neale's brother, John Mason Neale. At the time these societies were controversial in the Anglican church. At the age of 21, she gave her vows to the church. Her first work was at St Mary's Church, Charing Cross Road. She helped with caring for the sick and dying in the parish and teaching at the church's day schools and night schools. The work there was abandoned in 1865 but her experience was recorded in her two books \"Memories of a Sister of S Saviour's Priory\" and \"Old Soho Days and other Memories\" (in 1906).. In 1866 she joined a group who were forming a daughter house at Haggerston in the East End of London. Within two years many of the nuns had decided to leave the Church of England and to become Roman Catholics. In 1868 when she was 28, she became the mother to the remaining two nuns and the novices. The nuns who had left had taken all the funds and the building. Temporary homes were found but she would sleep on a table and their food would be cabbage.  They lived on Great Cambridge Street and ministered to the people of Haggerston with what was reported as its \"crushed down desolate poverty\". The group proved themselves when there was an outbreak of smallpox. They wrote to \"The Times\" and their appeal enabled them to give out food, clothes and bedding as they nursed those afflicted. She and the nuns went on to establish the instruments of social work. By 1888 they had created a dispensary, a nursery and the priory had a new building. Children were sent to their holiday homes in addition to the welfare they received during the rest of the year. \n\n## Death and legacy\n\n Warburton died in 1923 at the convent in London.

When the Revolutionary War broke out, she urged her sons to fight against the British. \n\n## Background\n\n The area now known as South Carolina was inhabited by Catawba, Cherokee, Waxhaw, and 26 other Native American nations that had lived in the area for centuries. It became a British colony named Carolina and was inhabited by European Americans first in the southern part of the colony, near Charleston in 1670. In 1710, the colony was split into North and South Carolina. White settlers began to settle in the northern part of what is now the state of South Carolina. Native American populations began to reduce in number, the population of native people in 1775 was a tenth of what it had been in 1600. The Cherokee, Catawba, and other peoples did not have immunity against diseases from Europe. Some villages were completely eradicated by smallpox and other infectious diseases. A lot of Native Americans also died during warfare with white people. Ultimately, they had been driven west away from their homelands. What had been a Native American path of the Catawba and other nations that went through present-day Chester County, South Carolina became part of the Great Wagon Road, which was used by settlers to travel from the northern colonies. Scots-Irish people left their homes in Virginia and Pennsylvania for Chester County in the mid-18th century. Fishing Creek and Rocking Creek were the first places that were settled. South Carolina saw more fighting than any other colony of the American Revolutionary War. Two of the key engagements in the northwestern part of the colony were the Battle of Kings Mountain and the Battle of Cowpens. \n\n## Biography\n\n Katharine Fisher was born in Pennsylvania about 1725 of Scottish-Irish ancestry, whose family had immigrated to the colonies from Ulster, Northern Ireland. She was described as being \"good-natured and fun-loving\", traits that she had throughout her life. She married Thomas Steel, who also descends from Scottish-Irish people from Ulster, in 1745 and they lived in Pennsylvania. She became Katharine Steel. The couple had three daughters and two sons. The Steel family moved to the wilderness of the Province of South Carolina, living about one mile from the Catawba River, along Fishing Creek. At first, they had occasional visits from the Catawba people, but lived remotely from other settlers. Thomas traded with the Cherokee. After a couple of years, John Gaston lived about one mile away along the creek. Their families, especially their sons, became close friends. Concerned about attacks from the Cherokee people, Thomas built a blockhouse for safety. Sometimes the men left the stronghold, called Steel's Fort, to maintain their crops or fight Native Americans. Steel, nicknamed Witty Katy of the fort, was a good marksman and had other characteristics, like intelligence and courage, that made her the leader of the fort. She had a calming influence that helped the women and children wait out the time until they could return to their homes. Steel taught her daughters how to fire rifles. John McDaniel had a family of nine living at Rock Creek. They were attacked by the Cherokee and John and his wife were killed. Their nine children were taken and Thomas led a group of people to claim the children, and they were returned to their uncle, Hugh McDaniel. Steel made it her mission to ensure that families were safe near and far away. She checked in on families as far away as 90 to the north in the Yadkin River area. During those times, she left her baby with Robert Brown who lived about to the north. She was particularly concerned for women who were left alone when their husbands were away. She rode up to a day through the wilderness to check on other settlers. Thomas died when during a journey to the Mississippi River to trade goods in 1763 or 1764. He had been gone for a year with Stephen White and James Hemphill, who returned safely. In 1775, Cherokee warriors attacked settlers, and one of Steel's sons John led a company of militiamen, including the sons of John Gaston, in a battle against the Cherokee. They fought together at Fort Moultrie (near Charleston, South Carolina) and further battles against the British during the Revolutionary War. John became a favorite of General Thomas Sumter after he saved the leader from capture. John was called the \"Murat of the Catawba\" during the Revolutionary War. Steel urged her 17-year-old son Thomas to join the war as a patriot. Thomas served with his brother. John Steel was at his mother's house when a group of Torys intended to ambush him. Steel saw the soldiers and shouted about their arrival. John as able to get on his horse and safely ride away, but several of his men were killed. They had been standing near Steel, and although her dress had four bullet holes, she was not injured. The Tories set Steel's house on fire. Some of John's men made it safely to General Sumter, but some of his men were captured. Steel died in 1784 at the old blockhouse. John was to have inherited all of his father's property, according to the laws at the time, but instead, the land was divided up among the five children. The three daughters and their husbands received large parcels of land. Margaret was married to William Wylie. Mary was married to Robert Archer. And, Nancy was married to Thomas Bell. John received his share of the subdivided land, which included the homestead. Thomas also received his share.

The club's name - often given simply as Portland - was taken from Portland Street in the town centre. The first time the club undertook competitive play was in the Scottish Cup in 1876\u201377. The club won its first tie 2\u20131 at Cumnock In the second it beat fellow Kilmarnock side St Andrew's 2\u20130, in a \"one-sided game\". The third round consisted of 21 clubs, and was still drawn on a regional basis; Portland lost 7\u20130 at the strong Mauchline side, to the surprise of those attending who were expecting a close game - at the time, with 130 members, Portland was the biggest club outside Glasgow, except for Vale of Leven, and had 60 more members than Mauchline. Portland conceded within 90 seconds of the start and the second goal came from a Portland attack, when Harrison \"selfishly\" failed to pass the ball, and Mauchline broke back. Portland was runner-up to Mauchline in the first Ayrshire Cup in 1877\u201378, losing 4\u20132 in the final, played at Holm Quarry, the home ground for a number of other Kilmarnock sides. The match proved to be a test between the Portland's wider wing play and Mauchline's more compact forward line; Portland's opening goal was a Goldie header from a Sinclair corner, and the club went 2\u20131 up after Mauchline's back Wilson impeded his goalkeeper, but two goals in the last 20 minutes won the trophy for Mauchline. The club reached the final again in 1878\u201379, beating Ayr Academicals in the club's penultimate tie by defending a one-goal lead through time-wasting tactics, continually sending the ball \"into 'touch'\". The club had also survived an apparent elimination by Beith, in a tie which included 500 spectators from Kilmarnock travelling by a special train; the only goal of the game came from a free-kick after an appeal for hands, which the referee had not actually given, but for which the Beith umpire had flagged. Despite Portland protesting the goal, which under the rules at the time would be considered later, Beith refused to play extra-time. The Ayrshire Football Association ordered a replay at Hamilton Park, which Portland won following \"a fine piece of cross-play\" between Harrison, Gallocher, and Goldie. Again however the club was runner-up in the final, losing to Kilmarnock Athletic in a replay, in extra-time; in that period Portland's captain Vallance sent the ball into the goalmouth from a free-kick, and the ball went through the goal without touching anyone. At the time, all free-kicks were indirect, so no goal was given. Worse for Vallance was that it was his slip near the end that presented Johnston with the winning goal. Portland had some consolation in 1878\u201379 by winning the Burns Cup, an invitational tournament to raise funds for a statue to Robert Burns, coming from behind to beat Mauchline 2\u20131 in the final - the first time the Portland had beaten the Mauchline. The club placed the cup in the Burns Museum in order to raise more funds for the monument. The season also saw the club gain its longest run in the Scottish Cup, reaching the fourth round, made up of 18 clubs; the first round saw Portland gain its biggest Cup win with a 9\u20130 score against Dean. In the fourth round, the club was drawn at home to the quasi-professional Dumbarton side, and earned a 1\u20131 draw (Vallance this time placing a free-kick \"beautifully\" for Campbell to equalize), but in the replay was 5\u20130 down at half-time, albeit some honour was gained with a (disputed) goal in the second-half. Portland finally won the Ayrshire Cup in 1881\u201382, beating Kilmarnock 4\u20130 in the final thanks to goals from Richmond (2), Connell, and Harrison, and completed a double with a win in the invitational Merchants' Charity Cup final, over Lugar Boswell. The club's defence of both trophies ended with defeats to Kilmarnock Athletic, which had reached the Scottish Cup semi-final for the previous two years, and which would go on to match Portland's double. With Kilmarnock Athletic losing players to English clubs, Portland looked as if it could take over the mantle as the leading side in Kilmarnock. However, in July 1883, despite having already entered the Scottish and Ayrshire Cups for 1883\u201384, the club disbanded. One problem was that the Athletic had been getting bigger crowds during the season. Portland's assets were put up for sale in September 1883. \n\n## Colours\n\n The club's colours were originally navy and white one-inch hoops.

Prior to 2019, \"J. oceanica\" was considered part of \"J. planata\", however a reexamination determined the land crabs on the oceanic islands to be a separate species. \"J.\u00a0oceanica\" differs from \"J.\u00a0planata\" in the shape of the mesial lobe of the infraorbital margin and the color of its carapace. \"J. oceanica\" is omnivorous and feeds on seaweed (algae), vegetation and sometimes carrion. It has been observed climbing trees to feast on leaves. On Clipperton, the introduction of species that prey on the land crabs has had a significant impact on the island's vegetation. The introduction of pigs on Clipperton Island by guano miners in the 1890s reduced the crab population, which allowed grassland to gradually cover about 80 percent of the atoll's land surface. The elimination of these pigs in 1958 caused most of this vegetation to disappear, resulting in the return of millions of crabs.

Guillory viewed the rigour of 'Theory' as an attempt by literary scholars to reclaim its cultural capital from a newly ascendant technical professional class.

He cultivated the violoncello, on which he distinguished himself. He was the author of a violoncello school, which appeared under the title of . Raoul composed also some sonatas and \"Airs vari\u00e9s\" for his favorite instrument. However, his efforts, supported by Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume, the well-known Parisian luthier, to restore the gamba to practical use were in vain. \n\n## Biography\n\n Raoul was born in Paris, in 1766. His sister, Fanny Raoul, was a feminist writer, journalist, philosopher and essayist. His official position was crown lawyer () and, later, as Justice at the Paris Cour de Cassation. He wrote a tutorial (Op. 4), . He composed also three sonatas (Paris, Pleyel) and \"airs vari\u00e9s\" for his instrument. Interesting were his endeavours to reinstate the viol da gamba, which he played himself. He was in possession of the famous gamba, by Gasparo Duiffopruggar, made in 1521 for Francis I. The back of the instrument showed a bird's eye view of Paris, inlaid in coloured wood. After Raoul's death, the instrument passed into the hands of Vuillaume, to form one of the greatest acquisitions of the museum of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. Dr. , whose friends heard the instrument played by Raoul, described its sound as one of penetrating sweetness (). Raoul conceived the idea of having a gamba made which should come nearer the violoncello in proportion, and Vuillaume made one on a new model in 1827, exhibited in the same year as the \"Heptachord\". The popular verdict was, however, not in favour of this revival of the gamba, which had not been heard of again until the early 20th century, when several musicians showed a renewed interest in historical instruments.

He led an unsuccessful Serbian invasion against Upper Syrmia in 1309\u20131310. \n\n## Family\n\n John was born into the \"gens\" (clan) Smaragd, an illustrious noble family of French origin. His father was Aynard, a prominent landowner in Valk\u00f3 County. John had two brothers, Nicholas and Smaragd. They were ancestors of the Ajn\u00e1rdfi branch of the Smaragd kindred, while John had no known descendants. \n\n## Career\n\n It is plausible that Aynard died not long before 1275. In that year, according to a non-authentic charter, John and his brothers divided the lands of Aynard in Valk\u00f3 County between the rivers Danube and Sava, including the lordships of Racsa, Atya, K\u00fcke and G\u00f6r\u00f6gmez\u0151, later all estates belonged to Syrmia County (present-day Sremska Ra\u010da [Serbia], \u0160arengrad [Croatia], Kukujevci [Serbia] and Vi\u0161nji\u0107evo [Serbia], respectively). Thereafter, John possessed extensive landholdings in Valk\u00f3 and B\u00e1cs counties, including the fort of Atya. In 1276, King Ladislaus IV exempted the people from paying tithe and marturina who lived in the estates of John \u2013 who was at tender age at that time \u2013 in the area between the rivers Sava and Bosut (also B\u00e1za or \"Basuntius\"), i.e. John's lands were excluded from the jurisdiction of the Ban of Slavonia. During the reign of King Andrew III, John served as \"isp\u00e1n\" of B\u00e1cs County in 1291. In this capacity, he took part in the royal campaign against the Duchy of Austria in the summer of 1291. He fought under the walls of Vienna, where he was injured. Upon his request, Andrew III confirmed the aforementioned privilege letter of Ladislaus IV in October 1291. It is possible that John married an unidentified noblewoman from the gens (clan) B\u00e1ncsa, a notable kindred in the region Syrmia too. His relatives, Thomas B\u00e1ncsa and his son Paul sold the estate of Zoch or Szat (near Man\u0111elos in Valk\u00f3 County) for 6 marks to John in 1297. Similarly to the others lords in the region, John was forced to acknowledge the supremacy of the oligarch Ugrin Cs\u00e1k, who ruled \"de facto\" independently the region of Upper Syrmia \u2013 including Valk\u00f3 and B\u00e1cs counties \u2013 since the last decade of the 13th century. However, John swore loyalty to Stefan Dragutin, the ruler of Lower Syrmia and entered his service. Under the command of John, Dragutin's Serbian troops invaded and pillaged Ugrin's domain in Syrmia and Valk\u00f3 counties in 1309 and 1310. However, the Serbian invasion was repelled by Paul Garai, a military commander of Ugrin Cs\u00e1k. During the counter-attack, John was captured and imprisoned. Later, Paul handed over the fettered prisoner to Ugrin Cs\u00e1k. John's fate is unknown. His nephew Ladislaus (son of Smaragd) requested the transcription of the aforementioned privilege letters from the cathedral chapter of B\u00e1cs (Ba\u010d, Serbia) in August 1332, implying that John's lands were confiscated and he died without male descendants by then.", "Joaqu\u00edn Gatica": "Joaqu\u00edn Ignacio Nicol\u00e1s Gatica Jim\u00e9nez (born 8 January 1986) is a Chilean former footballer who played as a defensive midfielder for clubs in Chile and abroad. \n\n## Club career\n\n After taking part of the Colo-Colo youth system, Gatica came to Coquimbo Unido at the age of fifteen, coinciding with well-known players such as Carlos Carmona, Nicol\u00e1s Crovetto, Al\u00ed Manouchehri, Mario Aravena, among others.

Born in 1910 to a family of staunch Presbyterians in Westfield, New Jersey, Jean Clark Dan graduated from Wilson College in Pennsylvania in 1932 where she studied biology. She pursued her graduate studies in invertebrate zoology at the University of Pennsylvania and spent her summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. At the Marine Biological Laboratory she met her future husband and scientific collaborator Katsuma Dan, the son of a prominent Japanese statesman. They were engaged in 1934, the same year that Katsuma Dan received his PhD. Jean received her PhD in 1936 and she and Katsuma were married that same year. Jean and Katsuma then moved to Japan where they continued their research at the Misaki Marine Biological Station of Tokyo University. Located 40 miles from Tokyo, the first three years of World War II limited the supplies available to the Dans. In 1945, the Misaki Station was taken over by the Japanese military for use as a midget submarine base. This forced Jean and her colleagues to relocate to temporary facilities. Jean and Katsuma also raised their five children during the war. After the war, while Katsuma restarted work at Misaki, Jean moved with her children to Nagai. Here she negotiated with the occupying U.S. forces to return land that had been seized by the Japanese military to local farmers. She also negotiated to use garbage from the U.S. army to rehabilitate Japanese villages. Because of this work to improve local living conditions she was nicknamed the \u201cGod of Nagai\u201d. Jean Clark Dan returned to the United States and the Marine Biological institute in a 1947 visit. Through her network of scientific colleagues she acquired the first phase contrast microscope. She brought this microscope back to Japan as a gift for her husband who refused the gift, insisting that she use it to return to her research. Jean would use a combination of electron microscopy and light microscopy in her research. Electron microscopy allows for a much higher resolution than light microscopy but the methods used in specimen preparation kill the cells under observation and can introduce artifacts. By combining these two types of microscopy along with electron photography Jean was able to make and document detailed qualitative observations about the process of fertilization in invertebrates. Both of Jean\u2019s \"Studies on the Acrosome\" (the second being published in 1954) pioneered the use of the electron microscope and served as the basis for Jean\u2019s initially disputed discovery of the acrosomal reaction. The acrosomal reaction is now recognized as a crucial part of the fertilization process in marine invertebrates. Throughout her research Jean Clark Dan won grants and fellowships from both the United States and Japan. She held an additional Japanese PhD, held a position on the editorial board of the Japanese journal \"Development Growth &amp; Differentiation\", and was recognized with an award by the Zoological Society of Japan in 1958. In addition to her work as a researcher Jean Clark Dan also worked as an educator. She worked first as a lecturer then as a professor at Ochanomizu University. Eventually, in 1975, she became the director of Ochanomizu University\u2019s Tateyama Marine Biological Station before retiring in 1976. Jean also worked as a translator, translating the work of Japanese biologists into English for publication. She also translated the book \"Children of the A-Bomb\" and assisted in English translations of the publications of Emperor Hirohito. Writing in her obituary for Nature, Arthur L. Colwin and Laura Hunter Colwin, who like Katsuma and Jean were a husband-wife team of embryonic researchers, described Jean on a personal level as a \u201cwarm and vital\u201d woman, \u201ca strong swimmer\u201d, a fan of wild mushrooms and sweet potatoes, the owner of a dog and a \u201cwhole family of Siamese cats\u201d, an enthusiastic idealist and educator, and the type of scientist who would decorate her laboratory with a flower in a beaker.

The proprietor was Peter S. Hyun, a Korean born in 1903. Hyun\u2019s ambition was to become the \u201cHenry Ford of Chinese foods\u201d, with chop suey and chow mein as familiar menu items on American tables as is pork and beans. \n\n## Early history\n\n In the 1930s, Jan-U-Wine operated as the Oriental Food Products Company. Peter Hyun claimed Oriental Food Products company was the largest Oriental food caterer and distributor in the country, serving over 200,000 persons every month. In addition to providing catering services for banquets and social functions from 35 to 1,000 persons, it also supplied stores and hotels in Los Angeles. A 1935 visit to the company\u2019s food factory revealed an impressive operation, with crates of imported mushrooms, tables crammed with fresh meats and chickens, and a machine that made noodle nests. Chicken turnover was made from tanks of creamy chicken gravy that became what customers see wrapped in cellophane on the grocer's shelf. \n\n## Products\n\n The Oriental Food Products Company provided delivery service of quart, half-gallon, gallon or any amount of chop suey to chow mein, with fortune cookies and crisp noodles to southwest residents in Los Angeles, as well as complete service at its 4100 South Broadway location. The company was open every weekday until midnight and 1:30am on Sundays and holidays. By the 1930s, they started producing canned Chinese foods under the name Jan-U-Wine. The trademark for Jan-U-Wine was filed on June 27, 1935. \n\n## Bean sprouts\n\n Peter S. Hyun introduced the first mung beans to California in 1936, importing them from China and using agricultural facilities of the Irvine Ranch to develop the American strain. It used a four-day process for growing bean sprouts in huge vats of water. There were only a few of them on the West coast, and they all operated under tight security as a top trade secret. By 1971, the plant turned out 100 tons of bean sprouts every four days. Jan-U-Wine Foods Corp. was the largest user of bean sprouts west of Chicago. La Choy operates the world\u2019s largest hydroponic garden for growing bean sprouts, and the process is a carefully guarded secret. \n\n## Canned goods\n\n Jan-U-Wine eventually became one of the country\u2019s largest manufacturers of oriental-style foods. They completed a new million dollar plant in the City of Commerce in the 1950s. By then, their offering expanded to include fancy bean sprouts, Chinese soup, chicken chop suey gravy, brown gravy sauce, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, soy sauce, chow mein noodles, chinaroni, cooked rice, fancy chop suey vegetables, chicken fried rice, fortune cakes, chicken sub kum, chicken chow mein, beef chop suey, mushroom chow mein, and the Triple-pac Mandarin Banquets that included mixed vegetables in the bottom can, chicken gravy in the middle can and crispy noodles in the top can. \n\n## Recipe books\n\n In 1960, Jan-U-Wine began distributing complimentary recipe books. This booklet featured 24 pages of Chinese-American recipes ranging from appetizers, salads, main dishes, vegetables, to desserts. The recipe book proudly proclaimed that Jan-U-Wine offered the most comprehensive line of Chinese foods in the world, all of which were included in the booklet. \n\n## Franchise\n\n Jan-U-Wine launched a national franchising program for take-home Chinese food in 1969. The franchise stores were responsible for packaging the food prepared by the company for take-home, and the first store opened in Anaheim\u2019s Village Shopping Center. Jan-U-Wine also created a cartoon symbol for the franchised units, featuring a character named \u201cJan-U-Wine Charlie,\u201d played by actor Victor Sen Yung, who had appeared in the Charlie Chan films and played a chef on the western series Bonanza.

Germany is one of the most important donor countries to the DR Congo. \n\n## History\n\n The German explorers Georg Schweinfurth (1863) and Hermann von Wissmann (1880) played an important role in the European exploration and discovery of the Congo. The latter acted on behalf of the Leopold II, the King of the Belgians with German ancestry. After the Congo Conference in Berlin in 1884/85, the Leopold founded the Congo Free State, which he ruled as his private property. The brutal exploitation of the Congolese population under Leopold's rule became known as Congo atrocities and claimed, according to estimates, between 5 and 15 million Congolese lives. When the cruelty of his rule became internationally known, he was forced to cede the Congo to the Belgian state in 1908. After the country's independence, the independent Congo and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) established diplomatic relations in 1960, and Patrice Lumumba traveled to Wetzlar, where he met politicians and business representatives. Lumumba's assassination a year later led to numerous reactions from the German public. European mercenaries, including Gerd von Blottnitz, fought in the following Simba Rebellion in the country. In 1970, Congo also established diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic (GDR). In 1978, the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit began its work in the country, which had been renamed to Zaire. In 1997, Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila took power in the country, overthrowing longtime despot Mobutu Sese Seko. The country was then renamed from Zaire to the Democratic Republic of Congo. His son and successor Joseph Kabila visited Germany in 2002, followed by another visit from him two years later. In 2015, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited the cities of Kinshasa and Goma, and a visit by Development Minister Gerd M\u00fcller followed a year later. \n\n## Economic relations\n\n A bilateral investment agreement between the two countries has existed since 1969, and in 2008 the German-Congolese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (\"Chambre de commerce et de industrie germano-congolaise\", CCIGC) was founded. However, economic relations are barely developed due to the country's unstable situation and many armed conflicts. So far, hardly any German companies have become active in the DR Congo, which has large raw material deposits. In 2021, the joint trade volume amounted to just under 223 million euros, of which 102\u00a0million were German exports to DR Congo. While Germany exports mainly chemical and industrial products to the country, it imports mainly food and raw materials in return. \n\n## Development aid\n\n Germany is the fourth-largest donor of development assistance (Official Development Assistance) to the country after the United States, France, and the European Union. Between 2015 and 2019, assistance amounted to 400 million euros. Development cooperation features three priority areas: peace and social cohesion, environment and natural resources, and growth and sustainable employment.  Successful joint projects implemented from 2008 to 2020 include the construction of drinking water points for 1.5 million people, the adoption of a national strategy against child labor, the opening of bank accounts for 1.8 million small businesses, and the construction of 800 km of roads, 120 schools, and 44 health centers. \n\n## Culture\n\n In 2013, the \"Society for German\u2013Congolese Friendship e.V.\" was founded in M\u00fchlhausen.

It is a naturally fermented milk product produced using the back-slopping method. To make Datshi, Dahi is first prepared from raw milk, the Dahi is then processed into  Mar(artisanal butter) by churning in a special wooden container called Theki. The Mar is collected and the liquid residue, called Mohi, is gently heated. The heating causes Casein to coagulate and the Mohi starts forming clumps. The Datshi is collected in a cloth and squeezed to eliminate extra whey and then rolled into appropriate sized cheese balls. Datshi is widely produced and consumed on a daily basis in Bhutan. It is a Bhutanese staple and is often used as a key ingredient in most Bhutanese curries. For example: the famous Bhutanese cuisine Ema datshi uses Datshi as the cheese and hence the name Ema Datshi. It is also used in various other dishes such as Kewa Datshi, Shakam Datshi and many more. In 2018, 74% of produced milk was utilized in the production of dairy products. The main dairy products produced were Mar, Datshi and Chugo, with Datshi being the most produced followed by Mar and Chugo. Bhutan currently does not export Datshi since the local demand outweighs supply. Matured Datshi, known as Zoetay(Dzongkha: \u0f5f\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f4f\u0f7c\u0f51, Wylie:ze-te), is also widely consumed in Bhutan.

WNBA player Brittney Griner was briefly incarcerated in the facility before being released in a December 2022 prisoner exchange for Viktor Bout.  \n\n## Conditions\n\n Prisons in Mordovia are regarded by many as having conditions harsher than most Russian prisons. According to University of Helsinki sociologist Olga Zeveleva, who works with the Gulag Echoes project studying Russian prison conditions, \"Prisons in Mordovia are notoriously terrible, even by Russian standards.

University of Oxford scholar Judith Pallot described the prison as being \"stuck in time for 50 years.\" Violence from other prisoners and prison guards is not as frequent as in men's prisons, but isn't uncommon. Prisoners at IK-2 Mordovia and human rights organizations have lodged complaints about conditions. Former inmate Olga Shilayeva, who was released in 2017, described frequent beatings by Vyacheslav Kimyaev, then a senior official. Kimyaev was later placed in charge of the facility. He was replaced by Yelena Pozdnyakova after a 2021 investigation by Russian authorities.

Cooke, who lived in the area when the state was known as the Republic of Texas. The community started at the crossroads of the old colonial road from Washington on the Brazos and Independence to Fort Tenoxtitlan and Nashville, crossing the Old San Antonio Road. Gabriel Jackson built the first trading post here. He also built a log house that was two stories high and operated a store on its first floor. The first settlers to Cooks Point were Anglo, while Native Americans followed suit. A.S. Broaddus led a wagon train of 80 White and 120 Black settlers from Virginia to the community in 1854. German and Czech immigrants settled after the American Civil War, causing the population to grow to 100 by 1884. A Methodist church was the first church established here. Other churches came after, such as a Baptist church by Broaddus and his party in 1881, a German Methodist church, and a Czech Brethren church. By 1990, only the Cooks Point United Methodist Church and the Brethren church remained. Cooks Point had a general store and a gin for some time. A post office was established at Cooks Point in 1874 and remained in operation until 1913. That year, the Houston and Texas Central Railway built a track through the community.

The computer's first product was a clone of the Apple II, called the Orange Peel. Ronning commissioned original equipment manufacturer Orange Computers, Inc., out of Toronto to manufacture the computer. It was able to run software for the Apple II but had slightly altered capabilities; as well, it used a custom ROM that was a clean-room design of Apple's BIOS for the Apple II. Around 95 Orange Peel units worth US$76,000 were sold between late 1982 and early 1983, before the computer was the subject of a confiscation at the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport in February 1983, when guards of the U.S. Customs Service seized four units from a cargo plane coming from Toronto. Executives of Apple had appealed to the Customs Service to look out for potential counterfeits of Apple's products in the years prior; almost 2,000 such counterfeits had been confiscated up to that point in total. Ronning stated that the Orange Peel did not contain any of Apple's copyrighted code nor infringed on Apple's trade dress, with an entirely different external appearance and detachable keyboard. Customs eventually cleared CompuSource of any wrongdoing in March 1984, calling the incident a mistake, but by that point Orange Computer had dissolved, and CompuSource moved on to another supplier. The company continued selling the remaining inventory of Orange Peels, at roughly $300, down from $795 in 1983 (both prices being a fraction of what Apple charged for their Apple IIs at the time). Shortly after CompuSource lost its first appeal against Customs in August 1983, the company switched to a different supplier of hardware for their next family of clones. Called the Abacus, these computers were manufactured by General Fabrication Corporation of Forest Lake. The Abacus comprised both a standard desktop computer and a portable computer, the latter with a built-in 9-inch CRT monitor and keyboard. Both were compatible with software written for the Apple II and for CP/M; the company licensed Apple DOS 3.3 from Apple and CP/M 2.2 from Digital Research. Ronning was able to avoid charges of patent infringement by deviating from Apple's floppy controller card for the Disk II and schemes to generate artifact color on composite video signals. Optional for both Abacus machines were a memory expansion card, a clone of the 80-Column Text Card, and an IBM PC compatibility card. The latter contained the circuitry needed to run software designed for the IBM PC running DOS, including an Intel 8088 microprocessor. IBM compatibility was somewhat constricted by the Abacus' RAM ceiling of 192\u00a0KB\u2014all but the oldest software packages for DOS up to that point required more. (CompuSource had been in negotiations with Microsoft to license MS-DOS for the computers but failed to get a contract by the computer's launch date.) The computers came with Compucalc, Compuword, and Compubase, spreadsheet, word processor, and database software respectively\u2014all developed by ArtSci of Los Angeles\u2014as well as three video games. The Abacus portables were introduced to market in January 1984, with the first 100 units delivered to 100 different dealers for inspection that month. CompuSource achieved volume production around February, manufacturing around another 15,000 in the following months. The Abacus portables were optioned with one or two floppy drives; a 10-MB hard disk option was planned for mid-1984.", "Comprehensive Migration and Mobility Partnership": "The Comprehensive Migration and Mobility Partnership is a bilateral agreement between the countries of India and Germany as a guidance for the citizens of these countries in the areas of studies, research and mutual work.

It was located south of Telford railway station. The town of Leigh Creek was built next to Telford railway station to support the coal mine, while the town of Copley was built next to Leigh Creek railway station. This prompted the renaming of the station to Copley in 1916. \n\n## Conversion to standard gauge\n\n The narrow-gauge railway south of Leigh Creek was under pressure from coal trains, with the coal trains getting heavier as time went on. A solution was needed to help increase capacity for the coal trains, with multiple options being identified for a standard gauge railway. These included upgrading the existing line to Leigh Creek or making a new railway that ran to the west of the Flinders Ranges, bypassing the Pichi Richi Pass. It was eventually chosen to build the new railway, and it opened to Leigh Creek in 1956 and Marree in 1957, with Copley being one of the places where the 2 lines crossed over. From then on, the original narrow-gauge alignment was progressively abandoned, with the Port Augusta to Hawker alignment finally being closed in 1972. As part of the new standard-gauge railway, the station was rebuilt with a brick station building similar to those at Telford and Marree, and a goods platform. \n\n## Decline and closure\n\n Regular passenger services through the town ceased when The Ghan was rerouted via Tarcoola, ending the need for an SG connection service through Copley. However, passengers could still use the station via a mixed goods service operating through to Marree until 1985, when this was replaced by a goods-only service. The service was curtailed to Copley in June 1987 and stopped operating in the mid-1990s. This left the Leigh Creek coal train as the only service on the line, but this did not service Copley. The coal train's only customer, the coal-fired power stations near Port Augusta closed in 2016. Mining at the coalfields ceased in 2015, though trains continued to transport the remainder of the coal until 2016. \n\n## Present Day\n\n Today, the standard gauge station building, goods platform, and water column survive.

The campaign was led by Shaykh Abdul Wahid, under the orders of Islam Khan I, against Raja Ananta Manikya in 1613. The conquest of Bhulua allowed the Mughals to successfully penetrate through southeastern Bengal and conquer Chittagong and parts of Arakan. \n\n## Background\n\n The Noakhali region was historically known as Bhulua and was ruled by the Bishwambhar Sur dynasty, an independent line of Hindu kings who enjoyed autonomy under the Sultanate of Bengal. The Mughal Empire defeated the Sultanate at the Battle of Rajmahal on 12 July 1576, formally establishing the Bengal as the easternmost province of the subcontinent-wide empire. However, the collapse of the Sultanate led to the formation of the Baro-Bhuiyans; a loose confederacy of independent chieftains across Bengal who continued to challenge Mughal domination.  During the reign of Emperor Akbar, Raja Man Singh I (1594\u20131606) was the appointed Subahdar of Bengal and responsible for warding off rebellious chieftains in the region. The Bhulua Kingdom was then under the rule of Raja Lakshmana Manikya. Lakshmana was among the Baro-Bhuiyans of Bengal, and was succeeded by his son, Ananta Manikya. \n\n## Campaign\n\n In 1608, Emperor Jahangir appointed Islam Khan Chishti as the Subahdar of Bengal, who continued his predecessors' campaigns to subdue the Baro-Bhuiyans and completely annex all of Bengal to the Mughal Empire.  In 1613, Abdul Wahid was appointed as the main commander of the Bhulua expedition by the Subahdar of Bengal Islam Khan I. He had command over 50 elephants, 3000 matchlockers and 4000 cavalry (including 500 of the Subahdar's own cavalry), in addition to the forces of Mirza Nuruddin, Mirza Isfandiyar, Haji Shamsuddin Baghdadi, Khwaja Asl, Adil Beg and Mirza Beg. The local raja, Ananta Manikya, began to set up defences around Bhulua with the Magh king's assistance, before proceeding forward to the Dakatia banks where he built a fort. Abdul Wahid's army reached the fort in a few days, and a battle commenced resulting in a number of deaths on both sides. Manikya's forces had also planned a surprise attack at night. However, the raja's chief minister, Mirza Yusuf Barlas, surrendered to Abdul Wahid, who rewarded him as a mansabdar of 500 soldiers and 300 horses. Manikya did not surrender after losing Barlas, and rather retreated to Bhulua at midnight to strengthen the fort there. News of the retreat reached the Mughals two pahars later, and so they began following the raja's forces. Having no time to defend themselves, Manikya retreated further to seek refuge with the Magh king Min Razagyi of Arakan but was defeated at the banks of the Feni River. The Mughals seized all of Manikya's elephants, and Abdul Wahid successfully took control of Bhalwa in 1613. \n\n## Aftermath\n\n Under Subahdar Islam Khan I, Bhalwa and Jagdia were established as frontier garrisons as the Mughals were aware of its strategic location as a crossroad between Mughal Bengal and Chittagong, then under the Arakanese kingdom. Bhalwa was integrated into the \"Sarkar\" of Sonargaon.

Nevin": "David Williamson Nevin was an American politician from Easton, Pennsylvania, who served as the city's mayor and is considered to be \"Easton's greatest citizen\". \n\n## Early life\n\n Nevin was born on September 9, 1853, in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. When he was 10 years old his father took him to Gettysburg where he heard the Gettysburg Address. His uncle, David Robert Bruce Nevin was a major in the Union Army and later an attorney from Philadelphia. Nevin went to study law at Lafayette College however, while he was studying he was nearly killed by tuberculosis in 1872. This near death experience played a key role in the remainder of Nevin's life as he would be described as full of energy, boundless, and never took anything for granted. \n\n## Career\n\n \n\n## Early legal career\n\n Following his belated graduation in 1875 Nevin worked for a city attorney for two years before passing the Northampton County bar and opening his own law firm in 1877. That year he would also run for Northampton County district attorney, but would lose the election. \n\n## Real estate development\n\n In 1887, Nevin's \"butter and egg man\" a local farmer named John Mann, who delivered produce to Nevin every Friday afternoon, was asked if he would be willing to sell his farm to Nevin on behalf of his uncle from Philadelphia, D.R.B. Nevin. Mann agreed citing the rising taxes which where threatening to put him out of business. Shortly after the sale was closed the Lafayette Traction Company, of which David was a principle shareholder, built the first electric trolley line up College hill in 1888. This came despite resistance from the city's influential Republicans who sought to preserve the rural nature of the area. Shortly after Nevin constructed an inn on Mann's former property on the summit of Weygadt Mountain named the Paxinosa Inn at the price of $100,000 in 1889 (roughly $34,500,000 in 2023). The inn was named after Chief Paxinosa of the Shawnee Indians who was pivotal in the ratification of the 1757 Indian treaty. Shortly after in 1890 Nevin began developing the area around his inn into luxury villas and a neighborhood known as \"Paxinosa Heights\", the district is still intact today but is now known as \"College Point\". As part of the development and due to his stature as a devout Presbyterian he financed the construction of the College Hill Presbyterian Church and helped oversee its library. There he would develop a patent for a library record system. The Paxinosa Inn was never profitable and Nevin was forced to sell it at auction in 1896. Shortly thereafter it burned down in a fire. It was rebuilt in 1905 with fireproofed bricks, but would burn down a second time shortly after. It was never rebuilt. The cause of the inn's destruction is credited it to being 600\u00a0ft above the Delaware River preventing firefighters from having a steady stream of water due to poor infrastructure and pumps at the time. Nevin designed and donated two parks to the City of Easton. One of which, Nevin Park, hosted the city's original fountain from Easton's center square in 1899 after the erection of the soldier's monument that stands there today. The fountain would be melted down as part of a scrap metal drive for World War II. Despite his real estate business taking a turn for the worse, Nevin became the director of the Easton National Bank and to serve as the secretary and treasurer of the Easton Suspension Bridge Company. \n\n## Political career\n\n Nevin never stopped showing an interest in local politics after his 1877 district attorney defeat. Ever since his encounter with Abraham Lincoln at the age of 10 he had been a lifelong progressive Lincolnite Republican. He would hold a series of roles in the city government before being elected as a city councilor for the second and third ward. By 1888 he was the council president and he motioned for the creation of the Easton Industrial Association to help bring industrial jobs to the city. Nevin would be elected mayor in 1911 and take office in 1912 serving two terms until 1920. Nevin is best remembered for his tough on crime platform. Easton, at the time, was a resort town people from New York and other cities to go and commit vices they otherwise wouldn't be able to, the largest of which was prostitution. Nevin would make it his top priority to shut down the city's 27 brothels in a manner that wouldn't be embarrassing to the women working in them. During his time as mayor he also worked to expand the city's fire and police departments. Additionally, in 1913 the city abolished the \"select and common councils\" for a new city commission government. The old system had a large 36 member elected \"common\" council that would represent the 25,000 residents of the city, while the \"select\" council was appointed by the mayor. This system was heavily criticized due to having the unelected select council having almost all the power, and with there being too many members of the common council resulting in endless political infighting. \n\n## Legacy\n\n Nevin park still bares the mayors namesake and in 2014 a $200,000 replica of the city's original iron fountain was restored to the park. Near the end of his second term, local historian William Jacob Heller wrote that Nevin had contributed to Easton's development \"perhaps more than any living man.\" Nevin was married and had three sons, Samuel W. Nevin, D. Burrowes Nevin and John D. Nevin. His father was an Elder of the College Point Presbyterian church. Due to Nevin's long life he would often talk about his trip to Gettsyburg when he was 10 years old and lamented that: \"I wish I had extended my hand, for if the president had taken one step toward me we could have shaken hands.\"", "D.

Heeschen": "David Sutphin Heeschen (March 12, 1926\u2013April 13, 2012) was an American radio astronomer, best known for his long and influential tenure as director of the U.S. National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) during the time that radio astronomy was transformed from a hands-on approach by a few individuals building their own instruments to a discipline with staff-supported user facilities servicing often large teams of dedicated observers. Heeschen grew up in Chicago, Illinois, during the hardships of the Great Depression. He served one year in the Army at the end of World War II, then enrolled at the University of Illinois intending to study agricultural science. Instead, he received his B.S. degree in engineering physics in 1949, and an M.S. degree in astronomy in 1951. Studying under Bart Bok at Harvard, Heeschen completed his Ph.D. in 1954. At Harvard, Heeschen played a leading role in commissioning the university's 24-foot and 60-foot radio telescopes. After spending one year as an instructor at Wesleyan University he returned to Harvard as a lecturer and research associate. In 1956, NSF awarded a contract to fund a new national facility in radio astronomy to Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI), a consortium of originally nine universities, including Harvard. AUI already held the contract to manage Brookhaven National Laboratories, but this was quite a different venture. Heeschen resigned his position at Harvard and soon moved with his family to Green Bank, West Virginia, the remote location of the new radio observatory. As the first NRAO scientific staff member, he soon became the assistant to Otto Struve, who had been appointed NRAO director after a rocky search. Indeed Struve proved unequal to the task of constructing the planned new 140-foot radio telescope. He resigned, and Heeschen was appointed as acting director at the age of 36, becoming, in 1962, director. During his subsequent eighteen-year tenure, he oversaw the construction of the 140-foot antenna, a 300-foot telescope, a 4-element interferometer; at Tucson, Arizona, a high-precision 36-foot telescope; and the Very Large Array west of Socorro, New Mexico. Heeschen was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1971. He resigned as director in 1978, becoming again a member of the NRAO scientific staff. He contributed to the innovative design of the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope which, beginning operation in 2000, became the leading instrument of its kind in the world. His own research was on extragalactic radio sources. He played an active role in the 1970, 1980, and 1990 decadal reviews of astronomy and astrophysics. Among other honors, he was president of the American Astronomical Society (1980-1982), a fellow in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and a recipient of the NSF Distinguished Public Service award. An enthusiastic pursuer of serial hobbies, he was at various times an ice skater, hiker, hunter, sports car enthusiast, yachtsman, and ham radio operator, the latter with high-speed ratings in Morse code. His marriage to Eloise (nee St. Clair) spanned from 1950 until her death in 2002. Heeschen died at his home in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2012 at the age of 86.

Morris initially displayed his new vehicles in an existing property at 36\u201337 Queen Street, but, in the early 1930s, he decided to erect a purpose-built showroom; the site he selected on the west side of St Aldate's had been occupied by a row of terraced houses. The new showroom was designed by Henry Smith in the neoclassical style, built in yellow ashlar stone and was completed in 1932. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of nine bays facing onto St Aldate's with the end pays projected forward as pavilions. The central bay featured, on the ground floor, an opening with three doorways and, spanning the first and second floors, a tall aedicula, formed by two vertically-stacked oriel windows flanked by Ionic order columns and piers supporting an entablature. The wings, which featured a curved section which swept round to meet the end bays at ground floor level, were fenestrated by sash windows on the first and second floors. The end bays, which were only two storeys high, were fenestrated in a similar style. Internally, the principal room was a large display area. After British Leyland decided to focus on the Austin brand, the showroom was closed and the building was acquired by the Lord Chancellor's Department, which converted it into a courthouse at a cost of \u00a35.2 million, to a design by the Property Services Agency. The crown court and the county court, which had previously been based at the old County Hall, moved into the former showroom after it had been officially re-opened by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, on 4 October 1985.

It was characterized by its high cost and was typically crafted through the combination of various materials. \n\n## Tartar cloths\n\n In Dante's time, the term \"Tartar cloths\" referred to rich fabrics of Oriental origin that were brought through Tartary from China and its borders. These cloths were known for their fine material, bright colors, and intricate designs, which were created either by weaving different colors on the loom or through other methods.  Tartarium was a highly expensive fabric made of royal purple color. It was likely crafted by combining silk and of goat's hair from Thibet. Marco Polo, a Venetian merchant who lived from 1254 to 1324, identified Nasich and Naques as types of textiles made using gold, and Tartarium was one among the examples. Polo's writings suggest that the fabric was crafted using a technique that involved weaving strips of gold into it. This is clearly evident in his description of the Great Khan's attire on his birthday, which he notes was made of the finest robes fashioned from beaten gold. As per the glossary that accompanies the \"Liber Custumarum\" and the wardrobe account of RIC III, the fabric known as Tartaryn, which was utilized as a lining material, was composed of a blend of linen and wool. It was markedly different from the earlier fabrics produced in Tars. \n\n## Origin and naming\n\n According to Warton, the term \"Tars\" does not refer to the city of Tarsus in Cilicia, but instead, it is an abbreviated form of \"Tartarin\" or \"Tartarium.\" The wardrobe accounts of Edward III of England indicate that \"Tars\" was an expensive item, as exemplified by the entry detailing a blue tartaryn jupon embellished with silver buckles, pendants, and garters. Boccaccio, in his commentary, describes the Tartarium cloths as being so expertly woven that no painter could match their quality with a brush. The origin and naming of Tartarium cloth are subjects of conflicting accounts among the sources. According to Colonel Yule, Tartarium cloth was not named after Tartary because of its place of production, but rather because it was brought to Europe from China through the territories of the Tatar rulers. Du Cange defined it as a fine cloth manufactured in Tartary. Skinner suggests that Tartarium cloth may have originated from Tortona, which is a city in the Milanese region. \n\n## Mentions\n\n In the literary work, \"The Floure and the Leafe,\" Chaucer made reference to Tartarium, a type of fabric. In \"The Flower and the Leaf\", we encounter tapestries referred to as \"verd\", due to the abundance of trees present on them. These tapestries were adorned with a minstrel-gallery running along their length. The gallery was used as a gathering spot, where a group of individuals, wearing white cloaks and crowned with fresh oak garlands, congregated. They carried trumpets adorned with rich tartarium banners, displaying their lords' arms. The trumpets were decorated with wide collars embellished with large pearls, as no expense was spared in their creation. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica has mentioned Tartarium in the volume 12 under section of Gold. In medieval Europe, cloth and fabrics infused with gold and silver threads were favored by royal figures and important religious leaders for their ceremonial attire, costly decorations, and hangings. These textiles were known by different names such as ciclatoun, tartarium, naques or nac, baudekin or baldachin (Bagdad), and tissue, and typically incorporated gold threads in conjunction with other materials. The inventories documenting the effects of Henry V make reference to russet and red tarteryns. Additionally, it is noted that the coote armor he wore was made of a Tars cloth. \n\n## See also\n\n Tissue (cloth)", "The Pretendians": "The Pretendians is a Canadian television documentary film, directed by Drew Hayden Taylor and released in 2022.

Lister was the only son of Thomas Lister, 2nd Baron Ribblesdale and Adelaide, the daughter of Thomas Lister (1772\u20131828). He was born at Armitage Park, Staffordshire. He succeeded to the barony in 1832 following his father's death: at just four years old he was the youngest Peer of the Realm. His mother remarried in 1835 to John Russell, 1st Earl Russell (the future Prime Minister); but she died in November 1838 shortly after giving birth. Lister and his sisters lived with Earl Russell and his new wife, Fanny,\u00a0 at 37 Chesham Place, London. Lister mainly received private tuition but did study for a time at Eton. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 4 June 1846. In 1849 Lister purchased the rank of cornet in the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards retiring the following year. In 1850 he was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the West Riding. Lister was a noted racehorse owner who \"may be said to have burst like a meteor on the turf\" following his purchase of Jonathan Peel's entire stud in August 1851; this purchase caused his step-father \"some anxiety\". He raced horses under his own name and that of his trainer William Day. His horses had some success: St. Giles was regarded by his trainer as \"about the second best horse of his year\", winning the Betting Room Stakes at Doncaster and the Great Northamptonshire Stakes. Lister would bet heavily on his horses against the advice of his trainer. In May 1853 Lister married Emma Mure, the daughter of Colonel William Mure of Caldwell, Ayrshire. They had five children: Thomas, Beatrix, Martin, Adelaide, and Reginald. The family lived in France for a time, \"a method of reconstruction often adopted in those days by families and single gentlemen who had ... galloped themselves out of their fortunes\". Lister committed suicide in 1876 while staying at Leukerbad, Switzerland \"having fallen on hard times due to his indulgence in racing.\" He was succeeded in the barony by his son Thomas.", "Talorcan son of Drestan": "Talorcan son of Drestan (; died 739) was king of Atholl in modern-day Scotland. \n\n## Background\n\n The \"Annals of Ulster\" record for the year 713 that Talorcan was \"bound\" by his brother, the Pictish king Naiton son of Der-Ilei. As Naiton's father was Dargart mac Finguine, this implies that Talorcan was the son of Naiton's mother Der-Ilei, who was probably a daughter or sister of the earlier Pictish king Bridei son of Beli. Talorcan's father Drestan was probably also a king of Atholl, or at least a member of its royal line. Talorcan may have been making a bid for the Pictish kingship in 713, as indicated by a further entry for the year in the \"Annals of Ulster\" recording the death of another of Naiton's brothers Ciniod son of Der-Ilei. Talorcan was \"completely bound\" in 734 near Dunollie, the stronghold of Cen\u00e9l Loairn, then under the control of Muiredach mac Ainbcellaig; before being drowned in 739 by the Pictish king Onuist son of Uurguist.

(SPI) in 1979 that simulates three hypothetical conflicts in the 1980s that involve China. \n\n## Description\n\n \"The China War\" is a two-player board wargame in which one player controls Chinese forces and the other player controls the forces opposing China, which vary from scenario to scenario. With 200 counters and 12 pages of rules, \"The China War\"s complexity was rated as 3 out of 5 by critic Nicky Palmer. \n\n## Gameplay\n\n The game uses an alternating \"I Go, You Go\" system, although the non-phasing player does have an opportunity to act during the phasing player's turn. The phasing player's turn includes: The non-phasing player then becomes the phasing player. Completing the second set of phases completes one game turn. There are no zones of control, and assaulting units can overrun defending units to attempt a breakthrough. Terrain affects both movement and combat. There are also rules for varying troop quality, specialty desert units, chemical and electronic warfare, tactical air support, nuclear weapons and Chinese mass wave attacks. \n\n## Publication history\n\n In 1979, \"The China War\" was published in Issue 76 of SPI's house magazine \"Strategy &amp; Tactics\" as a free pull-out game. The game, designed by Brad Hessel, and featuring graphic design by Redmond A. Simonsen, was also published as a boxed set. The game failed to attract an audience, and did not crack SPI's Top Ten Bestseller List. \n\n## Reception\n\n In Issue 77 of the British magazine \"Games &amp; Puzzles\", Nicky Palmer liked the \"fine map\", noting it was \"packed with detail about Chinese industrial capacity and generally making the players itching to get started.\" However, Palmer didn't like the very limited use of tactical nuclear weapons, saying \"it gives a relatively toothless impression compared with one might expect of tactical nuclear commitment.\" Palmer felt the Soviet invasion scenario was the best part of the game, calling the other two scenarios \"rather trivial.\" Palmer concluded by giving the game an Excitement Grade of 4 out of 5. In Issue 53 of \"Moves\", Claude Bloodgood felt that \"the movement/reaction rules are the strongest part of the game system, and around this all the rest fall into place nicely.\" Bloodgood also liked the terrain effects on both movement and combat, \"especially restrictions imposed by mountainous terrain.\" Bloodgood concluded \"\"China War\" is a fine game-system that requires a little extra effort to master, but well worth the time taken to learn it.\"", "Texas's 124th House of Representatives district": "The 124th district of the Texas House of Representatives contains parts of Bexar County.

It soon attracted the attention of photographers like Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen, who were trying to create photographs in the pictorialist style, in a similar way to painting. Steichen himself had training as a painter and with his technique of using gum bichromate over platinum print was able to add colour to this photograph of the Flatiron, taken at twilight, in Winter. He took the picture from the west side of Madison Square Park. He made three prints, respectively in blue, tan and orange-like colors. The final result seems inspired by the Japanese woodcuts, very popular at the time, and by American painter James McNeill Whistler \"Nocturnes\" paintings, while his subject is very distinctively American. The Middlebury College Museum of Art website states: \"Printed using colored inks, the photograph captures the interplay between the natural tree branches, the rainy streets, and the newly built Flatiron Building, one of the tallest buildings in New York at the time.(...)

He was particularly interested in Dunwich in Suffolk, a town mostly lost to coastal erosion, and published a history in 1754. \n\n## Life\n\n It is thought Gardner was born in Ombersley, Worcestershire, and brought up in Southwold, Suffolk. He trained in London to be an engraver, and practiced there. In 1719 he published \"A Pocket-Guide to the English Traveller\", containing 100 road maps; it was the first small-scale edition of John Ogilby's \"Britannia\" of 1675. He moved to Southwold, where he collected salt tax and was deputy comptroller. He was an intelligent antiquary, making numerous local discoveries, and accumulating large collections, particularly of coins. In 1745 he exhibited to the Society of Antiquaries \"A true and exact platt, containing the boundaries of the town of Dunwich, and the entries of certain records and evidences, and some things now in variance made the 14th of March 1589, by Ralph Agas\".

", "Thomas Peterkin": "Thomas Alexander Peterkin (1839-12 June 1926) was a British born New Zealand engineer and politician who was Mayor of Lower Hutt. \n\n## Biography\n\n Peterkin was born in 1839 in London. He found employment with the London and North Western Railway, later becoming a leading hand. He then emigrated to Victoria, Australia, to become manager of the Vulcan Foundry at Geelong. Three years later he superintended the building of a freezing works at Rockhampton and established a foundry there as well. He then became an engineer overseeing cable work before shifting to New Zealand. In 1876 he was appointed as a railway engineer at Westport, later becoming manager of the Christchurch Tramway Company. He rejoined the railways department, working at Hillside and Addington, and was again manager at Westport for seven years. In 1897 he moved to Wellington where he was a locomotive engineer. In 1907 he was elected Mayor of Lower Hutt, defeating borough councillors Albert Burton Clark and Frederick de Jersey Clere for the position. He presided over a period of large population growth and urbanisation. The council spent on upgrading sewage and water infrastructure and constructing public facilities causing the council to amass much debt.

It is found in Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, and Peru.", "The Buddhist Priest's Wife": "\"The Buddhist Priest's Wife\" is a short story written by Olive Schreiner, first published in 1922 in a posthumous collection of Schriener's stories titled \"Stories, Dreams and Allegories.\" Schreiner originally wrote \"The Buddhist Priest's Wife\" in Matjiesfontein, South Africa in 1891. Narrated in the third person, the story recounts a conversation leading to a final goodbye between a nameless man and woman. The behavior and attitude of the woman is most likely a representation of the New Woman, which was a popular feminist ideal at the time the story was written and published. \n\n## Plot summary\n\n The story begins with an unknown narrator saying to cover up the corpse of a woman; the speaker reflects on how this woman would like to rest now after travelling the world and accomplishing so much. The narrator asks a series of questions, revealing the character of the woman; she was intellectual, stoic, and loved by many men and woman, but was somehow alone her entire life and would want to be now. The speaker states that the woman looks young, so life must have been wonderful to her. The story shifts to a woman sitting by a fire in a recently packed up room in London. An old woman comes to check on the younger one to bring her a cup of tea. The young woman announces that she will be leaving right after her guest has come to visit her. The young woman ignores the tea and takes a silver cigarette case out of her pocket and begins to smoke by the fire. After a couple cigarettes and pacing around the room for a time, her guest, a man in evening dress, arrives. The two sit down together. It has been a while since the two had last met, the man is uncertain, but the young woman specifically identifies the timeframe as seven months. She offers him a cigarette and he insists she smoke with him as an exception, even though she normally does not smoke with men. The two discuss work and holiday before the young woman suggests he travel to Norway. She brings up a book she had sent him on sport in Norway, which he does not realize until now that it was a gift from her; she explains that there is a list she wrote at the back of the book with everything he would need for the trip. They discuss her decision to leave for India, and the man critiques her character, explaining that she should settle down, marry, and be a successful woman in London, not waste her life travelling abroad and meeting foreign peoples. The two go back and forth about marriage, sex, love from the point of their gender, but they are do not agree with the other. The young woman suggests he find a conventional American woman to suit his personal goals. After a while of discussion, the two prepare to leave. He asks when he will be seeing her again, and she says \"Oh, not at all!\", explaining that by saying good-bye to everyone she will not feel like she needs to come back. He does not believe her to be serious stating, \"You must come in ten years' time and we'll compare notes - you about your Buddhist Priest, I about my fair ideal American; and we'll see who succeeded best.\" She laughs, and the two of them put their coats on by the door. She asks the man for a kiss, and he obliges. The speaker adds that, years later, the man ponders if the young woman had touched the top of his head affectionately, like a mother to a sleeping child, but he cannot remember. The man then looks around the room; the young woman is gone. He rings the bell for the old woman who says the lady has gone already, leaving in a cab that was waiting for her. He asks where she had gone, but the old woman does not know and explains, \u201cshe had left orders that all her letters should be kept for six or eight months till she wrote and sent her address\u201d. The narrator states that this was eight years ago, and repeats how beautiful life must have been to \"it\" (the corpse) because it looks so young. \n\n## Analysis\n\n In her article, \"The Lifted Veil: Women and Short Fiction in the 1880s and 1890s\", Clare Hanson, a professor at the University of Leicester, suspects that the genderless narrator is a woman based on the tone of narration. Hanson reflects on how the narrator shifts the pronouns from 'she' to 'it' in the ending, explaining that this shift could be interpreted as the narrator feeling uneasy with the dead body because its appearance has disturbed the boundaries of life and death. In Elke D'hoker and Stephanie Eggermont's article \"Fin-de-Si\u00e8cle Women Writers and the Modern Short Story\", the two professors at the University of Leuvan, Belgium, explain that Schreiner effectively opens her story with the death of the main character, giving the story a strong sense of transience before the narrative changes to the young woman's life. The young woman and the man have an unconventional conversation, openly speaking about topics like sex and marriage. The young woman is attempting to express her love for the man in intellectual way, but he fails to see the meaning behind her words and realize that she is in love with him. Because of his blindness towards her love, the young woman thus advises the man to find a 'neutral' type of woman from America to suit his needs. This story shows a woman revealing to a man her desire to be with him, but the man cannot comprehend an independent woman who deviates from stereotypical femininity. The man expresses that she is doing nothing important in her life by being an so unorthodox to her gender. His ignorance of the young woman's affections lead her to leave London for India, living a self-destructive life that she knows will kill her; however, the narrator shows us that the young woman finds freedom from the gender constraints set by a patriarchal society.", "Thomas Chase Parr": "Thomas Chase Parr (1802\u20131883) was a British officer of the East India Company's Bombay Army.

Leader was the younger brother of the engineer Edward Leader Williams who designed the canal.

Leader had established a reputation as a painter of evocative and earthy country scenes by the time he made the painting.

Between 1865 and 1867, a station building, built of buff bricks from Coalbrookdale with Bath Stone dressings, and incorporating a tower and clock, was constructed for the GWR. Sources differ as to whether this was a new building, or remodelling of an earlier Brunel building. The building was granted grade II listed status in 1976. In 1989 a brand new station concourse was opened by British Rail, including a new booking hall. The station facilities in the 1860s station building were converted into a pub.

Police used \"Teen Angels\" magazine as an insider guide to learn gangs fashion trends and graffiti pseudonyms in the early 1990s. It was banned in some correctional facilities and not carried by most mainstream retailers. \n\n## In popular culture\n\n In the 1993 cult film Mi Vida Loca, the character known as Mona (\"Sad Girl\") flips through the pages of \"Teen Angel\" to show her sister the contents, describing it as a \u201cmagazine that shows how we were really like.\u201d", "The Birdcatcher (film)": "The Birdcatcher is a 2019 film directed by British film-maker Ross Clarke and written by Trond Morten Kristensen.

Their music is typically classified as punk pathetique ('pret-punk', or 'fun-punk'). The band consisted of Tedje van Asseldonk (a woman) and three gay men: Marti van Kerkhof, Thijs Maasen, and Andr\u00e9as Cuppen (Andr\u00e9). The idea to form a punk band came from Tedje, who had punk friends. Like many punk bands, Tedje en de Flikkers were associated with leftist political movements. They were actively involved with the Rooie Flikkers (Red Faggots), a gay liberation group that thrived in Nijmegen from 1975 to 1980, and that emphasized actions through theater and music. The goal of performances by Tedje en de Flikkers was to shock the audience with their explosive and exhibitionistic performances. Band members wore elaborate face-paint and leather suits, and used dildos and sado-masochistic equipment as props. Their song lyrics were explicit about gay men's sex, and included insults aimed at politicians. Dutch pop magazines called them \"the craziest punk band in the Netherlands\u201d. Some town mayors banned their performances. Their best known songs are \"Van Agt\" and \"Ik ben een hoer\". The lyrics of \"Ik ben een hoer\" (English translation: \"I am a whore\") address sexual liberation, a common theme of queercore music; this will remind audiences, for example, of the song \"I'm gonna be a slut\" from American queercore band Pansy Division. \"Van Agt\" references the politician Dries van Agt, also the subject of the first Dutch punk single \"Van Agt Casanova,\" released by Paul Tornado in 1977. Tedje en de Flikkers' song \"Op de Baan\" addresses the topic of gay cruising in a park. Tedje en de Flikkers played in concert venues including the Paradiso, de Melkweg, de Effenaar, at the club 013, Doornroosje, and the Cafe Royal in Zoutelande. They were interviewed by Radio Stad in Amsterdam.", "The Double Gate": "The Double Gate, also known as the door of the Prophet, is two adjacent gates, located on the southern side of the wall of Al-Aqsa Mosque just under the pulpit of the Imam, where it leads to the courtyards of the mosque through a double door, a corridor 82 m long and about 13 m wide and is called by the public \"Old Al-Aqsa\". It ends with the staircase of its exit in front of the tribal chapel, 80 meters from the triple door. It is a very old door that may be traced back to the Byzantines. The Double Gate and the Triple Gate are both part of the Huldah Gate in the Southern Wall of the Temple Mount. There is an opinion that the door is illiterate in the sense of the decorations of the magnificent top of the door, which resemble the decorations of the door of mercy (Umayyad of construction). The presence of Roman stones does not mean that the door is Roman in the reason of using the builders as a stone on it in Latin writing, But it was placed upside down, which indicates ignorance of its construction in the Latin language, otherwise they would have put it in the correct way. (The inscription is found on the front of the door from the outside). The door was used as an entrance from the Umayyad palaces that were located south of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque to the mosque's courtyards through a long corridor known today as the Old Al-Aqsa. \n\n## Biblical archaeologists claim\n\n Biblical archaeologists claim that this gate is one of the gates of the alleged temple in the name of their eternity mentioned in their book \u201cBook of Kings\u201d This is a false claim that was not supported by historical or archaeological facts.

The leaves are obovate, discolorous, spirally arranged and clustered towards the ends of the branches. They may be up to long and wide. Domatia are usually present, as well as glands on the leaf underside near the junction with the petiole. The inflorescence is an axillary spike or raceme, which carries numerous pentamerous white or cream flowers measuring about diameter. The flowers near the base of the spike are bisexual whilst those near the apex are male. The fruit is a drupe, at maturity measuring up to long, wide and high, with a short \"beak\" at the distal end. They are initially glaucous blue/green, becoming dark purple or red at maturity. This species is very similar to \"Terminalia catappa\", but is generally smaller in almost all respects. \n\n## Phenology\n\n The brown damson is semi-deciduous and may be bare for a brief period in the spring (Sep-Oct). Flowering occurs from September to May and the fruit may ripen at any time of the year. \n\n## Taxonomy\n\n This species was first described in 1977 by the Australian botanist Norman Brice Byrnes, and his nominated type was a specimen he collected near Townsville in 1971.

Prior to the publication of this new taxon, records of this species had been included with \"T. melanocarpa\". \n\n## Etymology\n\n The species epithet \"arenicola\" is from the Latin \"har\u0113na\", \"sand\", and \"-cola\", \"inhabitant\", which refers to the beach habitat that is favoured by this tree. \n\n## Distribution and habitat\n\n The brown damson is found in coastal forests in close proximity to beaches, often co-occurring with \"T. catappa\" and \"T. muelleri\".

Now, it sounds more like a collection, rather than a unified listening experience.\" Writing for \"Paris Transatlantic\", Nate Dorward described the solo set without electronics as \"prime-cut,\" and remarked: \"The density of event is extraordinary, the ideas cut into each other at a bruisingly rapid clip and every so often squashed down in half-strangled protestations, as Rutherford spars joyously with the quirky amplifying properties of his surroundings.\"", "Thomas B.

The painting shows Jesus Christ raising Lazarus of Bethany from the dead. Its dimensions are \u00d7 .  First acquired by Lievens' associate Rembrandt, it was donated to the Brighton Museum &amp; Art Gallery in 1903. \n\n## History\n\n Lievens painted \"The Raising of Lazarus\" in 1631. Over 1630-1632 he had a contest with Rembrandt to produce the best composition depicting \"The Raising of Lazarus\". The Lievens' painting is done primarily in shades of gray, and it is a night scene. Lievens also produced an etching based on the painting.  In 1871 the painting was included in the Old Masters Exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts. In 1884, the painting and an etching were sold for 12 guineas.

The subject matter of the painting is Lazarus rising from his tomb like a ghost figure. Jesus Christ stands on a raised surface with his hands clasped. He looks skyward into a beam of light. In the grave beneath Jesus, the two hands of Lazarus reach out of the grave. A woman resembling a nun at the grave's edge has a stunned look on her face. Other people are observing the scene, including a black woman holding a large white shroud. \n\n## Reception\n\n Writing for \"The New York Times\" in 2008, art critic Ken Johnson said the painting was \"An unusually austere composition, it has a simplicity and openness that enhance its mystery.\" He also stated that Rembrandt enjoyed the painting so much that he acquired it and hung it in his home. When Rembrandt fell on hard times later in his life, he sold Jan Lievens' version of \"The Raising of Lazarus\". Writing for \"Smithsonian\" magazine, Matthew Gurewitsch describes the painting as \"a gothic scene in a somber palette and with the utmost restraint\". He goes on to say that Lievens does not portray Jesus with grand gestures and he portrays Lazarus only as two hands reaching out of a tomb. He uses pale light to permeate the darkness and express \"intimations of spirituality\".

It was recorded on a budget of $3000, and only 1000 copies were pressed. The album received some local attention and radio airplay in the Richmond area, but remained relatively obscure until it was reissued in 2015.

Namely, \u201cIdiots First\u201d and \u201cThe Magic Barrel.\u201d At the time of his death in 1964, Blitzen had yet to formally finish both of the operas. The project was completed by American composer Leonard Lehrman and subsequently premiered in March 1977 in Bloomington, Indiana. \n\n## History\n\n The work began in the fall of 1962 after Blitzstein accepted a playwright-in-residence at Bennington College in Vermont. There, he became the friend of Bernard Malamud and shortly thereafter, began working on adapting two stories by Malamud into operas. However, he had previously imagined three not two, the other story not yet decided among many choices. The three stories were going to form three acts into one opera. On January 1, 1963, a contract was signed by Malamud giving Blitzstein full rights over the stories. Inspired by his travels to Israel, Blitzstein was interested in bringing the Jewish experience to the operatic stage in-line with other projects at the time like the film Fiddler on the Roof. On April 19, 1964, Leonard Bernstein had led an orchestra during a memorial concert to Blitzstein when he announced his plan to finish \"Idiots First.\" However, this never occurred nor did the estate's request for William Bolcom to take on the task. However, Leonard Lehrman was eager to do it and in 1970, the Blitzstein estate gave him permission. \n\n## Idiots First\n\n Blitzen began with \"Idiots First\" in 1961, quickly finishing the draft by 1963 although continuing to edit until his death the following year. The first of the operas was going to be 13 scenes, with eight singers, two speaking roles, and five silent actors. The opera was to dramatically follow a similar plot to his opera, Reuben, Reuben. The score only survives in pieces, scenes one through seven and scene nine archived with the others in sketched form or presumed lost. Lehrman's two-piano version premiered on August 3, 1974, performed by the Marc Blitzstein Opera Company as founded by Lehrman. It was well regarded by the press and public alike. \n\n## The Magic Barrel\n\n The second of the two operas was begun roughly around the same time, although the libretto was in its first draft by 1963. The opera takes a more inward look rather than relying on external action and has six scenes as opposed to the former 13. Only the music of the first scene and a singular song remain of the score to this day. The opera was not full enough to be able to reconstructed by Lehrman due to the missing parts and sketches.", "Tanaka (given name)": "Tanaka is a unisex given name of Shona origin, meaning \"we have become beautiful; good\" as well as \"we are in a state of beauty; goodness.\" Shona names are given to children regarding the circumstance of their birth, a child borne from a difficult birth may be named \"Nyasha\" so as to say \"we have experienced grace from God\" because he let both child and mother live.

If a light flickers so rapidly that it appears as continuous, then its perceived brightness will be determined by the relative periods of light and darkness: the longer the darkness, the weaker the light.  The law was first reported in a 1830 article by the Belgian scientist Joseph Plateau. This article stimulated the English photography pioneer Henry Fox Talbot to publish, in 1834, his own observations on this topic made back in the 1820s. While both scientists have followed each other's experiments, they maintained that they conceived the original idea independently. In 1863, the experiments of A. Fick suggested that the Talbot-Plateau law does not hold for strong light intensities. This suggestion was later proven by O.

She was one of the earliest known Chinese Indonesian women writers to be published in the Indies; her poems are considered to have surprisingly modern themes and ideas for their time. \n\n## Biography\n\n Little is known about Tan Tjeng Nio's early life or educational background. In the 1897 a book of her poetry, written in the Syair form, was printed by Albrecht &amp; Co. in Batavia. It was titled (Poem about three women friends, one of whom was seduced by a Peranakan man from Tangerang until she was bankrupt, compiled by Intje Ismail). In the poems, the female protagonists (named A, B, and C) come to realize that it as better to have control of their own lives even if they lived in poverty, and that celibacy may be preferable to marriage. More broadly, it served as a warning to young Chinese women to think twice about marrying men who went through the motions of romantic love in order to trick na\u00efve women out of their money; the contemporary advertisement by the publisher marketed it as such and praised its \"good Malay\". The poems also display many forms of physical intimacy between the three female protagonists, as well as a level of independence from their parents that is quite different from other Indonesian Chinese literature of the era.  Elizabeth Chandra speculates that Tan may either have had a European (or European-style) education, since she dealt with modern topics, or conversely she may have been illiterate since her poems were compiled by someone else. The compiler, Intje Ismail, was a journalist who published in the Malay Chinese press at around that time; Claudine Salmon speculates based on his name that he may have been a Peranakan Chinese convert to Islam.

It replaced the previous restaurant \"Zum Kaisergarten\" and operated for 8 years under the name \"Gabriels Tonbildtheater\" until adopting its current popular name to reflect the proximity to the Deutsches Museum. The building saw a much-needed renovation in the summer of 2013, which involved renewing the electricity and air conditioning to comply with new fire protection regulations. The cinema reopened in October of the same year with the movie \"The Butler\". \n\n## Program\n\n In four auditoria, Museum Lichtspiele shows a number of international movies and blockbusters in English, plus locally produced or dubbed children's movies in German.

An African American, she belonged to the Women's Municipal League, the Daughters of the Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the World, and attempted to set up official rules for joining the Northeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs, requiring that any applying clubs must be involved in charity and that every woman in the club must attend church. She was elected as president of the Northeastern Federation of Women's Clubs Inc on September 6, 1934. Her compositions \"A Summer Day\" and \"Love-Song\" were recommended as \"drawing room\" pieces. Louis Armstrong recorded her song \"Love Song\" as part of his 1933 single \"Laughin' Louie\", Armstrong historian Ricky Riccardi surmising it was \"a theme Armstrong must have played countless times while accompanying silent movies with Tate\u2019s Orchestra\". Vince Giordano and Gosta Hagloff identified the piece as one used as silent film accompaniment since the early 1920's, including Charlie Chaplin's \"Easy Street\" segment of the 1938 compilation \"The Charlie Chaplin Festival\". Howard Thurston also used \"Love Song\" as the accompanying music to his illusion \"The Levitation of Princess Karnac\".

Donald Petrie described the species in 1891. Plants of this species of forget-me-not are perennial rosettes which form loose tufts or clumps, with ebracteate, erect inflorescences, and white corollas with partly exserted or fully included stamens.  \n\n## Taxonomy and etymology\n\n \"Myosotis goyenii\" Petrie is in the plant family Boraginaceae and was described by Donald Petrie in 1891.  \"Myosotis goyenii\" is morphologically similar to other ebracteate-erect species, especially other South Island endemic species \"M. albosericea\", \"M. monroi\" and \"M.\" \u00d7 \"cinerascens.\" Plants of these species have densely distributed hairs on the rosette leaves that are antrorse (forward-facing), straight, appressed and parallel to the mid vein, short fruiting pedicels, and no retrorse (backward-facing) hairs on the leaves or calyx. \"M. goyenii\" can be distinguished from these species by its longer inflorescences and the glaucous, grey or grey\u2013blue color of most of its vegetative parts. Multiple specimens of original material (syntypes) of \"Myosotis goyenii\" were collected in different localities in Otago, New Zealand by Peter Goyen (from Arrowtown) and Donald Petrie (from the Cardrona Valley and Lake Hawea). The lectotype was designated by Carlos Lehnebach, and is lodged at the herbarium of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (WELT SP002484). Donald Petrie gave this species the specific epithet \"goyenii\" to honor his friend, Peter Goyen (1845\u20131927), who collected several specimens of it. Like Petrie himself, Goyen was a school inspector and naturalist who lived on the South Island of New Zealand. Two subspecies are recognized: \"Myosotis goyenii\" subsp. \"goyenii\" and \"M. goyenii\" subsp. \"infima\"\".\" The subspecies are allopatric, and can be distinguished from one another based on habit; length of the style, pistil and filaments; and anther exsertion. \n\n## Phylogeny\n\n \"Myosotis goyenii\" was shown to be a part of the monophyletic southern hemisphere lineage of \"Myosotis\" in phylogenetic analyses of standard DNA sequencing markers (nuclear ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA regions). Within the southern hemisphere lineage, species relationships were not well resolved. The two sequenced individuals of \"M. goyenii\" grouped with each other and with \"M. albosericea\" in the nuclear ribosomal DNA analyses, and with \"M. australis\" and other species in the chloroplast DNA analyses. \n\n## Description\n\n \"Myosotis goyenii\" plants have long woody taproots or fibrous roots, and are single rosettes that often grow together to form loose clumps or tufts. The rosette leaves have petioles 10\u201348 mm long. The rosette leaf blades are 7\u201340 mm long by 3\u201311 mm wide (length: width ratio 2.2\u20135.3: 1), usually narrowly oblanceolate, oblanceolate or narrowly obovate, widest at or above the middle (rarely below the middle), with an acute apex (rarely obtuse). Both surfaces and the edges of the leaf are densely covered in straight, appressed, antrorse (forward-facing) hairs that are oriented parallel to the mid vein. Each rosette has 2\u201340 erect, usually once-branched (sometimes unbranched), ebracteate inflorescences that are up to 350 mm long and are usually bifurcating in an open, forked 'V' shape near the tips. The cauline leaves are similar to the rosette leaves but smaller with shorter petioles, and decrease in size toward the tip. Each inflorescence has up to 26 flowers, each borne on a pedicel up to 3 mm long at fruiting, and each without a bract. The calyx is 3\u20135 mm long at flowering and 4\u20136 mm long at fruiting, lobed to half to almost all of its length, and densely covered in antrorse, straight to flexuous, appressed to patent hairs. The corolla is white, up to 14 mm in diameter, with a cylindrical tube, petals that are broadly ovate, obovate, broadly obovate or broadly obovate, and small yellow scales alternating with the petals. The anthers are partly exserted above the scales or fully included within the tube. The four smooth, shiny, light to dark brown nutlets are 1.7\u20132.7 mm long by 1.0\u20131.3 mm wide and narrowly ovoid in shape. The chromosome number of \"M. goyenii\" is unknown. The pollen of \"M. goyenii\" is unknown. It flowers and fruits from October\u2013June, with the main flowering and fruiting period from January\u2013February. \n\n## Distribution and habitat\n\n \"Myosotis goyenii\" is a forget-me-not endemic to two disjunct areas in the South Island, New Zealand, i.e. Marlborough and Canterbury in the north, and Otago and Southland in the south, from 450\u20131300 m ASL. It is found on steep slopes, rock outcrops and ledges, on schist or limestone substrates. \n\n## Conservation status\n\n The species is listed as At Risk - Naturally Uncommon on the most recent assessment (2017-2018) under the New Zealand Threatened Classification system for plants, with the qualifier \"Sp\" (Sparse).

Edward Brewster Sheldon, who died in 1946 at the age of 60, wrote this sentimental drama in 1913 and it made the actress Doris Keane a memorable figure in American theatre. \n\n## Reception\n\n Brooks Atkinson of \"The New York Times\" called it \u201cpretentious fiddle-faddle,\u201d while John Chapman of the New York Daily News said that the \u201clovely\u201d Jeffreys made for an \u201cenchanting operetta heroine\u201d who sang Romberg's songs \u201cas though they meant something.\u201d ", "Mount Winthrop": "Mount Winthrop is a prominent mountain summit located in Okanogan County of Washington state. The mountain is part of the Hozameen Range of the North Cascades and is situated south of the Canada\u2013United States border within the Pasayten Wilderness, on land managed by the Okanogan\u2013Wenatchee National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Frosty Mountain, to the northwest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Similkameen River. Like many North Cascades peaks, Mount Winthrop is more notable for its steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation. Topographic relief is significant as the west aspect rises above Route Creek in . The Pacific Northwest Trail traverses the southeast slope of the mountain and the Pacific Crest Trail traverses the western base of the mountain. \n\n## History\n\n The first ascent of the summit was likely made in 1940 by Everett Darr and H.L. Frewing. There is no record of the namesake for this mountain, however in Washington the town of Winthrop and the Winthrop Glacier are both named after Theodore Winthrop who toured the Washington Territory in 1853 and wrote of it in his book, \"The Canoe and the Saddle\". He had an interest in the local mountains as he was the original advocate that Mount Rainier and Mount Baker should instead be called by their Native American names, \"Tacoma\" and \"Kulshan\" respectively. \n\n## Geology\n\n The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, granite spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \"U\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. \n\n## Climate\n\n Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.", "Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (Palestine)": "The Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities in Palestine is a governmental body responsible for the development and management of the tourism sector in Palestine, as well as the preservation and protection of the country's cultural heritage and antiquities.

The difference to single transferable voting is, that any votes for parties below the electoral threshold are transferred to other parties according to the ranking on the ballot across party lines. The parties below electoral threshold are determined by first preference counts. The use of the electoral threshold could reduce the fragmentation of the parliament. This electoral system is a type of open list party-list proportional representation, where the preference of candidates within a party-list is indicated by ranking.  This electoral system was first used in 1989 Australian Capital Territory general election, with an electoral threshold of 5%. Here ranking only parties without ranking candidates was possible by voting above the line. A similar preferential party system is the spare vote electoral system, which ranks political parties.  \n\n## Disadvantages\n\n If the electoral threshold is set below the natural threshold, then the results of Modified d'Hondt electoral system is indistinguishable from the more common single transferable voting. This was the case in the Australian Capital Territory general election, where the natural threshold was higher than the explicit electoral threshold of 5%.

It was easier to sound mysterious in the 70s, when your career, the story behind your career, and the subtext under everything you did weren't put under a microscope.

The specific name refers to Bah\u00eda Salado, the locality in which the type specimen was found. \n\n## Description\n\n \"Micrauchenia\" was a small macruacheniid, similar in size to \"Cramauchenia normalis\" and \"Coniopternium andinum\" and smaller than \"Cullinia levis\", which, prior to its description, was considered the smallest macraucheniine. \"Micrauchenia\" weighed up to . The robust metapodials are proportionally similar in terms of relative length and width to \"Theosodon\", in contrast to \"Cullinia levis\", in which they are proportionally more slender and elongated. The right mandible fragment preserves just the dorsal portion of the ramus with the coronoid and the condylar processes. The condylar process is small, cylindrical and posteriorly has a slightly convex articular facet where it articulates with the glenoid fossa on the squamosal. The mandibular notch is anteroposteriorly very narrow. The coronoid process is anteroposteriorly narrow, dorsoventrally elongated and mediolaterally slender. There is no sign of a condyloid crest in contrast to \"Cramauchenia normalis\" and \"Macrauchenia\" which share a subtle but noticeable condyloid crest dividing the masseteric fossa into two halves. In \"Theosodon\", the condyloid crest may be variable, as there appears to be a very subtle ridge in \"Theosodon garretorum\", but this is absent in \"Theosodon lydekkeri\" specimens.\" Llullataruca shockeyi\" also seems to lack a condyloid crest. Apart from differences in the development of the condyloid crest and differences in size, the general outline of this element is very similar to Miocene macraucheniids like \"Theosodon\" and \"Llullataruca\", and also to more derived Pleistocene macraucheniids like \"Macrauchenia\", which indicates that over time this element has been mostly conserved within this family. \n\n## Paleobiology\n\n \"Micrauchenia\" lived in a coastal environment with lush sclerophyll woodland and shrubland vegetation.", "Monastery of St. Anthony (Meteora)": "The Monastery of St. Anthony () is a former Eastern Orthodox monastery that is part of the Meteora monastery complex in Thessaly, central Greece.

Hinson Jr. (1966\u20132022) was an American Black and LGBTQ activist, educator, and researcher who lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was the chief executive officer of SELF, Inc. \n\n## Life and works\n\n Michael Hinson grew up in Wilmington, Delaware and Hemingway, South Carolina and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Legal Studies from Peirce College and a Masters in Public Administration from Cheyney University of Pennsylvania. At the time of his passing in 2022, he was completing a Doctor of Public Administration at Capella University. Hinson was also a prominent member of Philadelphia's Yoruba community, becoming a Yoruba priest in the early 1990s. He was a founder and director of the Colours Organization in Philadelphia from 1991 to 2000, where he developed innovative programs addressing the broader health needs of Black LGBTQ people. In this period, Hinson developed a variety of innovative outreach and education programs to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Black gay community, serving as a co-chair of the Philadelphia AIDS Community Planning Group, and contributing to \"The Time to Act is Now!,\" a comprehensive set of recommendations on preventing HIV infection and AIDS in the wider African American Community. In addition to the founding of Colours, he also played a pivotal role for many organizations in the city, lending his energy and talents to help strengthen the LGBTQ service infrastructure in Philadelphia. As part of this work, he helped found Philly Black Gay Pride in 1999 and was one of seven founders of the Black Gay Men's Leadership Council founded in 2006. He was also an integral member of the grass roots, community-based organization Black and Latinx Community Control of Health. In 2005, in his role as LGBTQ+ liaison in the Street Administration, Hinson funded the LGBT Community Assessment, an assessment of the broad health related needs of LGBT populations in the Philadelphia region, and worked closely with community researchers Chris Bartlett and Heather Batson to complete the research. Through his leadership, the City of Philadelphia and Philadelphia Foundation subsequently funded an LGBT Youth Assessment, which he also envisioned and funded. After leaving the Street administration, Hinson eventually began working as a leader nationally in Black and LGBTQ+ community organizing. Michael was one of the founders of the International Federation of Black Prides (now Center for Black Equity) and served as the Board Chair from 1999 to 2010. He was the IFBP/CBE Director of Programs from 2010 to 2018. In these roles, he helped increase IFBP/CBE membership from eight Black Prides to thirty-two Black Prides around the globe. Additionally, he invested in Black leaders nationally and internationally, bringing effective strategies he had implemented in Philadelphia to many other communities. During the final leg of his career, Hinson turned his focus back to addressing homelessness in Philadelphia, an area that was part of his work during the Street administration. Hinson was a passionate advocate for people experiencing homelessness. From 2017 until his death in 2022, Hinson he served as the President and CEO of SELF, Inc., the city's largest provider of emergency and transitional housing, which doubled in size under his leadership and included the development of Way Home, a partnership with the William Way LGBT Community Center that provides rental assistance for LGBTQ+ people. Upon the onset of the COVID pandemic, Hinson also led efforts to assure that homeless people were protected and received the health services they needed when infected. Hinson's leadership on homeless issues resulted in his election as a co-chair of the Philadelphia Roadmap to Homes Committee, which determines priorities for the City's federal funding for homeless services. He also served as a board member of Philadelphia Family Voices, an organization supporting families of children with autism and other behavioral health challenges, and, as a member of the Philly Homes 4 Youth Coalition, advocated for homeless young people in Philadelphia, in particular those who had been in the foster care system. Throughout his career, Hinson worked very closely with the three people he identified as his strongest mentors: David Fair, Tyrone Smith, and Rashidah Abdul-Khabeer. He built upon their commitments to insure the unapologetic centering of the voices of Black and Brown, LGBTQ, and other communities who benefited from his strong voice. He was well-known for his mentorship of others, described as \"a coach for a generation of Black LGBTQ leaders in Philadelphia.\" Hinson said in a 2018 Philadelphia Magazine interview \"Even on the days when the weight of the challenges seems insurmountable and the loneliness of the roads traveled seems endless, I am forever grateful for the opportunities and platforms available to me to contribute in a small way to the humanity I know we all deserve.\"", "NAACP Image Award for Activist of the Year": "The NAACP Image Award winners for Activist of the Year.", "NGC 551": "NGC 551 is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Andromeda.

A registered member of the Three Affiliated Tribes and the highest ranking Native American in the history of the NPS, Baker incorporated Native American perspectives at Mount Rushmore and headed the Corps of Discovery II project to commemorate the Lewis and Clark Expedition. His tenure at Little Big Horn was marked by conflicts with admirers of George Armstrong Custer. \n\n## Early life and education\n\n Baker was born and raised on Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota. He has two brothers and a sister. His mother was Hidatsa, and his father, Paige Baker Sr., was Mandan and Hidatsa; Baker speaks the Hidatsa language.

As a new park ranger, Baker replaced the ranger band on his hat with an Indian-beaded band to the consternation of his supervisor. Some of his posts included Knife River Indian Villages, Fort Union Trading Post, Little Missouri National Grasslands, and the Beartooth and Ashland districts of Montana. From 1984 to 1993, Baker worked for the United States Forest Service as an assistant district ranger and American Indian program manager for the Ashland Montana District. In 1993, Baker became the second Native American superintendent of Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument (succeeding the first Native American superintendent, Barbara Booher). The previous superintendent had begun the process of changing the monument's name, Custer Battlefield National Monument. When the name change was enacted during Baker's tenure, he received \"angry letters, a petition for removal, and seven confirmed death threats\". During the 120th anniversary ceremonies at Little Bighorn in 1996, Lakota tribe members performed a victory dance and touched the monument marking the 7th Cavalry Regiment mass grave to symbolize counting coup. Fans of George Armstrong Custer claimed that Baker was \"Indianizing\" Little Bighorn and accused him of allowing the descration of the grave.

In 2004, Baker was appointed superintendent of Mount Rushmore, the first Native American to hold that position. As superintendent, Baker promoted Native American education programs and added interpretive displays to incorporate the perspectives of the tribes. He created the Heritage Village exhibit featuring tipis to represent the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota nations. The exhibits and Indian speakers that Baker added became some of Mount Rushmore's most popular features with the public, however there was local criticism that his additions did not belong and that he was imposing his \"personal values\". Discussing the criticism, Baker said: At Mount Rushmore, Baker worked on modifying forest management policies to address a pine beetle infestation. After Greenpeace members scaled Mount Rushmore and displayed a protest banner in 2009, Baker stated that the security system had worked as designed, but received criticism from the public when an investigation found that some parts of the monument's security system were inoperable.

Sempill was the son of Robert Sempill and Elizabeth Abercromby. In 1712 his father had been created Lord Sempill of Dykehead in the Jacobite peerage and Sempill would use this title after his father's death in 1737. He was born at the exiled Stuart court at Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye and educated at the Scots College, Douai. From 1730, Sempill became one of the most prominent and active Jacobite agents in France, and acted as the unofficial Stuart ambassador to Louis XV at Versailles after the Stuarts were forced to leave France for Rome due to the Anglo-French Alliance. Reflecting the confused nature of Jacobite politics at the time, Sempill worked alongside, and sometimes against, Daniel O'Brien and George Kelly who had also been commissioned to represent Stuart interests in France.  In the five years before the Jacobite rising of 1745, Sempill was responsible for greatly exaggerating Jacobite strength in order to gain French support, something which resulted in him earning enmity from both Jacobites and the French. After the death of Cardinal Fleury, Sempill carried a message to Louis XV from several prominent from English Tories requesting support for a restoration of the Stuart line. The French foreign minister, Jean-Jacques Amelot de Chaillou, replied that considerable proof of English support for Jacobitism would be required before France could act. Sempill conveyed inflated and inaccurate confidence in the strength of the cause and a Franco-Jacobite invasion of Britain was planned towards the end of 1743. Such was Sempill's conviction that Prince Charles Stuart travelled to Paris, where he stayed at Sempill's house on the rue de l'Estrapade. The planned French expedition was, however, abandoned in the summer of 1744, by which time Prince Charles had lost trust in Sempill and publicly mocked him as \"Lord Simple\". Sempill was excluded from Prince Charles's plans for a new rising, but he subsequently worked to persuade Louis XV to mount an invasion during the 1745 rising. His efforts were embarrassed by the failure of England to rise in support of the rising and ended with Jacobite defeat at the Battle of Culloden. By this stage, Sempill had also lost the confidence of James Francis Edward Stuart.  He had married Lady Mary Caryll, widow of Hon. John Caryll and daughter of Kenneth Mackenzie, 4th Earl of Seaforth.

By 1905, more than three million hectares of land was in timber reserves. The first attempt at a commercial pine plantation was made at Tuncurry State Forest on the mid-north coast in 1912. Eucalypt plantations followed in 1939\u201340 at Wallaroo State Forest and Whian Whian State Forest (now Whian Whian State Conservation Area) on the north coast.

Contestants selected from the studio audience tried to imitate scenes acted out by Vague in pantomime. Each correctly reproduced movement earned $10 for the contestant and added $10 to the jackpot for that episode.

It was led by a twelve-member cabinet known as the Revolutionary Command Council, whose chairman was Muammar Gaddafi, which came to govern the Libyan Arab Republic. \n\n## Background\n\n Since Libyan independence, King Idris's rule was unpopular due to the widespread corruption of his government, regional favoritism, and perceived preference of foreign interests over those of Libyans. The kingdom made little effort in attempting to unite the country and poorly managed Libya's internal affairs. The discovery of significant oil reserves in 1959 and subsequent income from petroleum sales caused the poor nation of Libya to establish a wealthy state, however the nation's wealth was increasingly concentrated in the hands of King Idris and the elite. This led to many Libyans supporting Muammar Gaddafi's coup.  Gaddafi established the Free Officers Movement at the Libyan Royal Military Academy in Benghazi in 1964, a revolutionary group which met secretly. After the Arab defeat in the Six-Day War in 1967, the Free Officers were convinced that the monarchy had to be replaced. They became one of the several groups plotting against the monarchy, succeeding in 1969. By 1969, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was expecting parts of the Libyan Armed Forces to launch a coup. Although they claimed that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since ignored it, stating that they were instead monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group. \n\n## Coup d'\u00e9tat\n\n In mid-1969, Idris travelled abroad to Turkey and Greece during widespread rumors of a coup by the Shalhi brothers on 5 September. Gaddafi's Free Officers recognized this as their chance to overthrow the monarchy before the Shalhi brothers, initiating \"Operation Jerusalem\". On 1 September 1969, a group of about 70 young army officers from the Free Officers Movement and enlisted men mostly assigned to the Signal Corps upsurped the government and abolished the Kingdom of Libya. The coup started in Benghazi and was completed in two hours. Army units quickly reassembled in support of the coup and established military control over Tripoli and in other places across the country within a few days. The Free Officers occupied airports, police depots, radio stations, and government offices in Tripoli and Benghazi. Gaddafi captured the Barqa barracks in Benghazi, Umar Muhayshi took over Tripoli barracks and Jalloud seized the city's anti-aircraft batteries. Khweldi Hameidi captured the Tripoli radio station and was sent to arrest crown prince Sayyid Hasan ar-Rida al-Mahdi as-Sanussi and force him to give up his claim to the throne. The coup was popular among the civilian population, especially younger people. There was no resistance in Cyrenaica and Fezzan and no deaths or injuries were reported. The Free Officers Movement was headed by a twelve-member cabinet that called itself the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC). This body formed the government after the coup d'\u00e9tat. In its proclamation on 1 September, the Revolutionary Command Council declared the country to be an independent and sovereign state with the name of the Libyan Arab Republic, which would continue \"in the path of freedom, unity, and social justice, guaranteeing the right of equality to its citizens, and opening before them the doors of honourable work.\" They characterised the rule of the Turks and Italians and the \"reactionary\" government which were overthrown as belonging to \"dark ages\", from which Libyans were called to move forward as \"free brothers\" to a new age of prosperity, equality, and honour. \n\n## Ideology\n\n The Free Officers were republicans and were hostile to the monarchy and King Idris because of their social marginalization to many lower and middle-class Libyans. They strongly rejected the policies and principles of King Idris for his corruption and close links with Western nations. After the Six-Day War in 1967, the Free Officers demanded \"total political and economic independence from any kind of foreign (non-Arab) influence, direction, control or constraint. They introduced policies that called for social justice, self-determination, Arab nationalism and anti-imperialism. They strongly supported Pan-Arabism and support for Arabs everywhere, as well as Arab socialism. They were also in support of Islamist values and Shari'a. \n\n## Composition\n\n The Free Officers Movement was composed of lower and middle-class Libyans from less prominent tribes who were not affiliated with the Senussi family or other powerful families of Cyrenaica. All but one of them studied at the military academy and did not go to university. The formation of the Free Officers Movement was taken from Gamal Abdel Nasser's example of the Egyptian Free Officers. \n\n## Membership\n\n Major officers of the movement include:", "Germany\u2013Yemen relations": "Germany\u2013Yemen relations have existed since the 1960s. During the civil war in Yemen, the Federal Republic of Germany provided humanitarian aid to the country. \n\n## History\n\n As early as 1606, the lansquenet Hans Wild reached Yemen and later published reports of his experiences in the Islamic world. In the 18th and 19th centuries, German-speaking explorers such as Carsten Niebuhr, Ulrich Jasper Seetzen, Alfred von Kremer and Eduard Glaser traveled and explored the country. In the early 20th century, the German Empire unsuccessfully sought to lease a naval base in Al Hudaydah. As part of the Stotzingen Mission, Germany sought to establish a military intelligence station in Al Hudaydah during World War I, which also failed. In 1933 and 1935, the composer Hans Helfritz traveled to Yemen and made films on behalf of UFA. In doing so, he deliberately circumvented Joseph Goebbels' directive to portray foreign peoples as culturally inferior. The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen remained a neutral power during World War II. In the postwar period, the FRG envoy in Cairo toured the city of Aden and British-occupied southern Yemen in 1953 with the German consul in Jeddah. Three years later, Muhammad al-Badr visited the GDR, and soon after the latter established a trade mission with consular authority in the Kingdom of Yemen (from 1962 on the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen). Diplomatic relations between the Federal Republic and the Yemen Arab Republic were established in 1962 and the FRG made significant contributions to the development of the hitherto isolated country and German development workers, teachers, physicians and archaeologists came to the country. Diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Yemen or South Yemen were also established in 1967. In the same year, the ARD correspondent Walter Mechtel was killed in Aden. The GDR established close relations with the Socialist People's Republic of Yemen from 1969 and also established relations with the Yemen Arab Republic in 1972. The reunification of the two Yemeni states took place in 1990, almost in parallel with German reunification. Due to the poor security situation in the country, the German Embassy in Sanaa had to be closed in 2015. The ensuing civil war led to foreign intervention in the country and a severe humanitarian crisis. German weapons were also used in the war, as German arms companies had supplied weapons to participants in the foreign coalition in Yemen, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In 2017, the German government under Angela Merkel offered to accept a mediation role between the warring parties. In 2019, members of the German Armed Forces participated in UN missions in Yemen. \n\n## Economic relations\n\n In 2013, Germany exported goods worth 227 million euros to Yemen and imported goods worth 4 million euros in return. With the start of the civil war in 2015, the exchange of goods between the two countries has decreased. In 2021, the bilateral trade volume was around 180 million euros, placing Yemen 123rd in the ranking of Germany's trading partners.  There is a double taxation agreement between the two countries for the aviation sector (2007) and an investment protection agreement (2008). However, due to the difficult situation in the country, there has been little investment by German companies. \n\n## Development cooperation\n\n Germany has been providing development aid in Yemen since the 1960s. In 1983, the German Society for International Cooperation opened an office in Sanaa. Yemen-Kinderhilfe Aichach e. V. was founded in 2003. German development aid focuses on education and water supply. In 2021, the German government allocated 200 million euros to combat the humanitarian crisis and hunger in the country. \n\n## Cultural relations\n\n The German Archaeological Institute has been involved in the preservation of Yemen's cultural heritage and some Yemenis have studied in Germany. German culture and research has a good reputation in Yemen, however, cultural exchange is hampered by the poor security situation in Yemen. The German-Yemeni Society has promoted cultural contact between the two societies since 1970. \n\n## Migration\n\n In 2021, just under 9,000 Yemenis lived in Germany, nearly 1,200 more than two years earlier. Well-known German Yemenis include Green Party politician Tarek Al-Wazir.", "Francis Toppesfeld": "Francis Toppesfeld (died after 1427) was an English Crown servant who became a judge in Ireland.

Toppesfeld married his wife Alice, an heiress who is said to have brought him a considerable landholding in Ireland. They were visiting England in 1410, having appointed Thomas Shorthalls, later another colleague of Toppesfeld on the Court of Exchequer, as their attorney. Thomas Duke of Clarence-effigy  Clarence, his employer, had left Ireland for good in 1409; he was killed fighting in France in 1421.

Pepe was born the year after his father opened his pizzeria, where his mother worked the till.His father encouraged him and his siblings to study and not go into the pizza business, and one of his brothers studied accounting, the other architecture, Pepe physical education.  \n\n## Career\n\n Pepe's father died in 1996, and he and his brothers felt a responsibility for continuing their father's business. Pepe eventually wanted to change their father's recipes and methods, and his brothers did not want to, and Pepe left the business to start his own nearby. The relationship was damaged. Pepe's pizzeria is in Caiazzo in Campania, about an hour from Naples. His first pizzas were pizza fritte, but customers thought fried pizza was too heavy. He worked on lightening the dough and started producing what he called conetto, a tricorner puffy fried dough that he sliced into two smaller horns and garnished with fresh herbs, and these became popular. \n\n## Methods\n\n Pepe focuses on local produce and on dough. He uses a slow-fermentation method but does not refrigerate his dough. Eventually he became known outside of Caiazzo. Jonathan Gold visited and wrote an article in \"Food &amp; Wine\" calling Pepe's pizza \"probably the best pizza in the world\". He uses three different flours to produce a light, chewy crust.  Pepe makes a pizza Margherita Sbagliata, or \"mistaken Margherita\", which places mozzarella as the base, and after the pizza is cooked, an uncooked tomato sauce and basil sauce as garnishes. Faith Willinger explains that Italians reject reimagining classic dishes such as pizza Marherita, so when Pepe calls his version \"mistaken Margherita\", he is saying, \"I am making an error here\". He makes a fried pizza topped with apricot jam and buffalo mozzarella. \n\n## Reception\n\n Faith Willinger, author of \"Eating in Italy\", calls out Pepe's pizza as her favorite in Italy, saying that he is \"the only pizzaiolo in Italiy, if not the world, who does all of his dough by hand\".

It is situated on the western side of the Panchane River, opposite the village of Giriyak. \n\n## Name\n\n Giriyak Stupa is also known as \"Jarasandha-ka-baithak\" (Jarasandha's Throne). Jarasandha was a legendary king of Magadha. He was the son of a king named Brihadratha. \n\n## Description\n\n As it appears today, the stupa is a cylindrical tower, the wall of which is lined with a brickwork veneer. It is in diameter and in height, resting on a high square foundation. When construction of the stupa was completed (about 1500 years ago), there was a solid brick dome atop the cylinder, which in turn was capped with a stone umbrella canopy. Its height at that time \u2014 from the bottom of the foundation to the top of the canopy \u2014 is estimated to have been at least . The style of ornamentation is of the Gupta period (4th - 6th century CE), similar to that of the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya. The ruins of a Gupta-era brick Buddhist temple are located nearby. Other nearby structures are the Mauryan (4th - 2nd century BCE) and Pala (8th - 12th century CE) periods. \n\n## History\n\n The hill on which these structures are found very closely matches the account of the \"Hill of the Isolated Rock\" related in 400 CE by the Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian, as well as the description by Xuanzang of the hill of \"Indra-sila-guha\". Faxian made no mention of the stupa, but Xuanzang (c. 622 CE) did mention it. This led Alexander Cunningham (founder and first Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India) to the conclusion that the stupa was probably constructed around 500 CE. According to an ancient legend, Buddhist monks built the stupa over the body of a dead goose. Cunningham found a broken sculpture with a carving of a goose on its pedestal, which supports his assertion that Giriyak Stupa is in fact the structure referred to in Xuanzang's account. Francis Buchanan-Hamilton visited the area in 1811, as part of a survey of the areas within the jurisdiction of the British East India Company. He reported the presence of a tunnel or entrance at the base of the stupa, which he believed to have been created by a treasure hunter. In 1870, Alexander Cunningham excavated a shaft from the top of the stupa all the way down to the stone foundation and then extended the earlier tunnel until it connected with the shaft. These excavations failed to reveal any information about the history of the structure. \n\n## Restoration\n\n The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) conducted extensive restoration work on the cylindrical pillar of the stupa from 2011 until 2016. The badly decayed cylindrical wall of the stupa has been covered with a layer of bricks, and the tunnel at the base of the stupa has been filled.", "Ginetta-Zytek 09S": "The Ginetta-Zytek 09S, also known simply as the Zytek 09S, was a sports prototype race car, developed by Zytek Engineering as a Le Mans Prototype, following their partial merger with Ginetta, in 2009.

The relations are described by the German Foreign Office as \"friendly.\" The two countries share a close partnership in development cooperation, and numerous cultural ties exist between the two countries. \n\n## History\n\n Senegal first became known in the German speaking world through the travelogue \"Reise nach Senegal\" by the French botanist Michel Adanson, published in German in 1773. As part of the French Colonial Empire, soldiers from Senegal fought in First (1914-1918) and Second World War (1939-1945) against Germany. In June 1940, members of the SS Totenkopf Division and other units murdered 188 Senegalese soldiers in France. L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor was also captured and narrowly escaped being shot. In 1950, Senghor befriended the German writer Janheinz Jahn, whose publications decisively changed and modernized the (West German) image of Africa. Senghor became the first president of independent Senegal in 1960. In 1955, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) established a consulate in Dakar in French West Africa, which was converted into an embassy five years later. The first ambassador of the FRG to Senegal was Walter Reichhold. In 1968, Senghor was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade as Senegalese president. In the process, the award ceremony in Frankfurt am Main was met with protests by left-wing activists who accused Senghor of being an \"African ideologue of colonialism and neo-colonialism\" because he pursued pro-Western policies. The conclusion of a cultural agreement in 1970 deepened cultural cooperation between the two countries, and three years later the Goethe-Institut expanded into Senegal. After the end of the Hallstein Doctrine under Chancellor Willy Brandt, Senegal also established diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in 1973. The following year, a Senegalese embassy was opened in Bonn, the capital of the FRG. After German reunification, Senegal moved its embassy from Bonn to Berlin. In the 21st century, cultural and political relations continued to deepen, and in 2006 the \"Senegalese-German Business Association\" (SeDeWi) was founded following a visit to Germany by Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade. In 2013, Senegalese-born Karamba Diaby was the first African-born politician to be elected to the German Bundestag. Former Bundestag member Charles M. Huber also has family roots in Senegal on his father's side and has had a house in Mbour since 2004, where he has also lived for a time. In August 2018, German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the Republic of Senegal. \n\n## Economic relations\n\n Economic relations between the two countries are still poorly developed and, for Senegal, lag behind those with the former colonial power France and the People's Republic of China. The bilateral trade volume between the two countries was 213 million euros in 2021. Germany exports to Senegal mainly chemical and industrial products such as cars and machinery, and in return imports food and raw materials. An investment protection agreement was concluded between the two countries in 1967 and negotiations on a double taxation agreement began in 2018. \n\n## Culture\n\n German institutions present in Senegal include the five political foundations (Friedrich Ebert Foundation, Friedrich Naumann Foundation, Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, Konrad Adenauer Foundation, Rosa Luxemburg Foundation), the Goethe Institute, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) and an advisory group of the Bundeswehr. There are many contacts and partnerships between cities, schools and parishes or dioceses. Projects exist in the fields of music, photography, visual arts and modern dance. There is also cooperation between the two countries in research and higher education. Since 1973, there has been an institute of German studies at the University of Dakar, and in 2002, Dr. Ibrahima El Hadj Diop was habilitated at the University of Duisburg-Essen, becoming the first Germanist in the country. In Senegalese schools, German is the fourth most popular foreign language and in 2010, 17,588 people in Senegal were learning German. The two countries also have close ties in sports. The Germans Otto Pfister (1979-1982) and Peter Schnittger (1999-2000) were national coaches of the Senegalese national football team. Senegalese footballers such as Papiss Demba Ciss\u00e9, Demba Ba, Mame Diouf, Lamine San\u00e9, Souleymane San\u00e9, Bouna Sarr and Sadio Man\u00e9 were active in Germany. Leroy San\u00e9, son of Souleymane San\u00e9, became an international for Germany. \n\n## Development cooperation\n\n Germany is an important donor country for Senegal in development aid. Since the country's independence until about 2022, Germany has provided nearly 900 million euros in development aid. The partnership focuses on energy, education, and job creation.", "Geophis fulvoguttatus": "Geophis fulvoguttatus, also known as Mertens's earth snake, is a snake of the colubrid family. It is found in El Salvador and Honduras.", "Frankfurt-Hohenheim Leitfaden": "The Frankfurt-Hohenheim Leitfaden (Frankfurt-Hohenheim Guidelines) is the first criteriology for ethical-ecological evaluation methods for monetary and capital investments. The guide screens public companies for cultural, social, and natural compatibility and is the most comprehensive criteriology for ethical investments. It was developed in 1997 by the research group \"Ethical-Ecological Rating\", which Johannes Hoffmann and Gerhard Scherhorn founded in 1992. \n\n## History\n\n In 1989, Johannes Hoffmann, a business ethicist at the University of Frankfurt, was asked by managers at Deutsche Bank, where church institutions had invested money in the tens of billions, to develop a criteriology for evaluating capital investments. In 1991, Hoffmann contacted the then Wirtschaftsweisen, Professor Gerhard Scherhorn of the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart. Together they came to the conclusion that without a differentiated scientifically elaborated criteriology, which, in addition to economics and ecology, also took into account the rationale of culture-specific human rights, no sustainability agency, company or investor could be persuaded to invest in ethical-ecological products. Therefore, in 1992, both founded the research group \"Ethical-Ecological Rating\", which started its work in 1993. Initially, the group met either in Frankfurt or in Hohenheim to develop or distribute concrete tasks and questions to the researchers. To achieve interdisciplinarity in the group, it was initially composed of scientific collaborators from Scherhorn's and Hoffmann's fields. After several symposia in the following years, further experts from Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and representatives of Christianity, Islam and Buddhism became involved. Discussions were held on the inclusion of cross-cultural questions on human rights and on survival criteria of industrialized, developing and emerging countries. Consistently, these specifications led to a discussion of the 1986 United Nations Declaration on the \"Right to Development.\" Subsequently, sociologists, philosophers, natural scientists and theologians, as well as other collaborators from all practical disciplines, countries of origin and religious faiths were recruited for the project to ensure its concrete intercultural usefulness. This resulted in the Frankfurt-Hohenheim Guide in 1997, which, with 850 individual criteria, was the first theoretical basis for the ethical evaluation of companies and capital investments. Since then, the guide has been the basis for the evaluation of ethical-ecological assessment and rating methods for monetary and capital investments. \n\n## Initial thesis\n\n The 1995 report of the Club of Rome states that the limits to growth have already been exceeded. Economic leaders have come to the conclusion that economic growth no longer serves to increase people's prosperity, but has rather become an end in itself, serving to increase monetary wealth. Therefore, social forces should be mobilized to create cultural pressure that enables the social market economy to mediate between liberalism and socialism, between competition and solidarity, and between economy and ecology. In order to achieve changes in the global economic system, money flows must be directed into channels that lead to small-scale changes in the normal range and that provide for innovations that could bring the destructive potentials associated with our economic system under control, and provide impulses for the development of a socially, naturally and culturally compatible mode of production and economy. Up to now, the evaluation of financial investments or companies has been based on creditworthiness, profitability, transaction costs, maturity and tax aspects. Against the background of cultural pressures and social movements, money should also be invested with ethical considerations in mind. More and more people are apparently starting from the premise that ethically based investments can be an instrument for ensuring economic changes that produce ecologically and socially compatible technological developments. \n\n## Methodology, Structure\n\n The criteriology with a total of 850 individual criteria is based on the concept of allegorical value tree analysis according to Ortwin Renn, a German sociologist, economist and sustainability scientist. \n\n## Cultural compatibility\n\n Examines the compatibility of economic activity with the progressive cultivation of society's will to shape itself in the direction of the individual's opportunities for life and development, the community's ability to integrate, the survivability of the natural world with and after us, and the opportunities for cultural development (cf. 1986 Convention on Human Rights). \n\n## Social compatibility\n\n Describes working conditions, social standards and human rights. In order to avoid social dumping and human rights violations, globally applicable framework conditions are essential. This includes uniform corporate standards on hiring and firing principles, equality principles, remuneration and job security, among others. \n\n## Nature compatibility\n\n Assesses the main criteria specifically for eco-rating and is broken down into the action areas of environmental institutions, information, technology, living things, energy, materials, transport and emissions.", "Genevieve Mina": "Genevieve Mina (born 1996) is an American politician serving as a member of the Alaska House of Representatives for the 19th district.

He married band singer Frances Irvin, and settled in New York City where he played with such musicians as Lee Konitz and Claude Thornhill. He then joined the continuation Glenn Miller Orchestra led by Tex Beneke, where he met Henry Mancini. When Mancini began writing music for television series such as \"Peter Gunn\", he invited Cipriano to join him in California and contribute on flute. The two worked together many times on television and film scores in later years, and Cipriano played the clarinet solo on Mancini's \"Baby Elephant Walk\". Cipriano also worked with many other TV and film composers, including Michel Legrand, Andre Previn, Neal Hefti, Lalo Schifrin, and Marvin Hamlisch. During his career he recorded music for numerous television shows including \"Batman\", \"The Flintstones\", \"M*A*S*H*\", \"Mission Impossible\", \"Star Trek\", \"The Simpsons\", and \"American Dad\". He played on \"West Side Story\", performed the saxophone part for the character played by Tony Curtis in the film \"Some Like It Hot\", and played on the soundtrack of both the original \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" and its 1999 remake. Cipriano was also a noted session musician in Los Angeles, as a member of \"The Wrecking Crew\". Initially, he was sought by Harry Nilsson to play oboe, and subsequently played on many pop hits of the 1960s and 1970s, including those by the Beach Boys and the Monkees. Other musicians with whom he worked included Frank Sinatra, Neil Diamond, Rosemary Clooney, Stan Kenton, Tony Bennett, Frank Zappa, and Lady Gaga. Fellow musician and record producer Tom Ranier said that Cipriano was \"one of, if not the most, recorded woodwind player in history having played on thousands of record dates, movies, jingles and TV shows.\" In 2019, it was reported that Cipriano had played in the Academy Awards orchestra in each of the previous 59 years. As a jazz musician, Cipriano played many shows and on over 200 recordings, including as a member of Thelonious Monk\u2019s band on \"Monk's Blues\". He also played with Gerry Mulligan, Shelly Manne, and many others. He made his only album as a leader, \"First Time Out\", a double CD on which he played all the solos, in 2006 at the age of 78. On the album, he played saxophone, clarinet, and English horn. Ranier said of the album: \"He played all his instruments superbly, producing beautiful singing sounds on each.

Originally commissioned as a piece of war art by the War Artists Advisory Committee, it depicts crowds of workers walking into the Mather &amp; Platt engineering equipment factory in Manchester, north-west England. The painting now hangs in the Imperial War Museum North. \n\n## Description\n\n \"Going to Work\" presents a grey, industrial scene of hundreds of factory workers walking towards the Mather &amp; Platt engineering works at Newton Heath in Manchester. The crowds of workers are painted in Lowry's characteristic style as \"matchstalk\" figures, all walking in a uniform direction towards the focal point of the factory gate to the left of the picture. Beyond the gate, the figures continue filing into an array of ancilliary factory buildings. In the background can be seen the turret of the Mather building, and in the foreground, the ends of a pair of red Manchester Corporation buses protrude into the field of view. Distant barrage balloons fly above the factory buildings. The pale-coloured ground was previously thought to represent a layer of snow, but art historians now consider this to be an evocation of industrial haze. The painting is signed in the bottom-left corner \"L.S.LOWRY 1943\". \n\n## History\n\n Lowry painted the scene during a period of reduced artistic activity in his life. The death of his mother in 1939 took a heavy emotional toll on him, and Lowry produced little during the war. Despite living through two world wars, Lowry was not noted as a prolific war artist. During World War II, he served as a fire watcher in Manchester and produced a small number of paintings in the 1940s capturing the aftermath of the Manchester Blitz, among them \"After the Blitz\" and \"Blitzed Site\", but other works of this time bear no visual evidence of wartime activity. \"Going to Work\" was commissioned in 1943 by the War Artists' Advisory Committee (WAAC) as part of an initiative to create a visual record of Britain during the years of World War II. The project involved a body of work by over 400 official war artists who captured scenes of the war effort. The WAAC wanted to reflect the important role of heavy industry in the war effort, and so Lowry's contribution was a scene of workers going into an engineering factory. He was paid 25 guineas for the commission and it was completed in three months. Allen Andrews notes that \"Going to Work\" is a typical example of a Lowry industrial scene, and that there is nothing in Lowry's image to distinguish it as \"war art\" except for the addition of a pair of barrage balloons, inflatable objects that were used to deter enemy bombers during air raids. When the painting was finished, it was displayed in a number of exhibitions in Britain and internationally. After World War II, \"Going to Work\" was given to the collection of the Imperial War Museum and was held in storage in London for many years. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1976. In 2019 the piece was brought out of storage and underwent restoration. It is now on public display in the Imperial War Museum North, alongside works by other artists such as Flora Lion and Anna Airy. Another watercolour piece by Lowry of the same title was painted in 1959. It depicts a similar scene to his 1943 oil painting, with crowds of workers filing into factory buildings, and the two works have some common architectural elements. Formerly held in the collection of Salford Museum and Art Gallery, the watercolour is now on public display in The Lowry at Salford Quays. The Mather &amp; Platt works depicted in Lowry's painting were built in 1900 and stood for many years after the war. The factory continued in operation until it finally closed in 2019.

For the final crime, he was sentenced to 70 years imprisonment, but his date of death is unclear. \n\n## Early life and first murder\n\n Little is known about Francisco de Marco's background. Born in 1922, he was convicted for unspecified sexual crimes as an adult, for which he served three years imprisonment. Released either during the late 1940s or early 1950s, he settled in Mar\u00edlia, where he married and had three children. According to neighbors, none of whom were aware of his previous convictions, he was considered a humble and peaceful man who made an honest living as a glazier. De Marco's first recorded murder occurred on March 1, 1953, when he lured 7-year-old Iracema Rubino dos Santos, the daughter of a neighbor, to a cornfield under the guise of helping him with the harvest. He then proceeded to rape and asphyxiate the girl before dumping her body at a farm behind the town stadium. He was quickly arrested and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for this crime, which he served at the Mar\u00edlia Public Jail. A model inmate, de Marco used his prison privileges to escape confinement after serving three years of his sentence. \n\n## Later murders\n\n By 1961, de Marco had moved to the municipality of Ponte Nova in Minas Gerais and worked under the alias 'Darci Nogueira', where he would commit two additional murders. The first was an unidentified 14-year-old girl, whom he shot with a garrucha in unclear circumstances. This crime was witnessed by a young boy, Antonio Carlos Fernandes, whom de Marco threatened to kill. A week later, Fernandes was tracked down, raped, shot twice in the head and had his body set on fire. De Marco then fled to Guaxup\u00e9, where he soon apprehended by authorities. For these murders, de Marco was sentenced to an additional 30 years imprisonment, which he served in several prisons across S\u00e3o Paulo. By early 1981, when he incarcerated at the Carandiru Penitentiary, he was granted parole under the conditions that he be supervised by family members. De Marco then settled in Rio Claro, where he lived with some family members as required. Unbeknownst to the authorities, he began searching for victims yet again, luring them with offers of sweets and candies to an abandoned farmhouse, ostensibly to pick fruits. When they were alone, he would proceed to sexually violate and asphyxiate his victims, emasculating them if they were male. On October 22, 1982, de Marco killed and emasculated 11-year-old shoeshiner Alberto Ant\u00f4nio Antonelli and then dumped his body at the Edmundo Navarro de Andrade State Forest. From the remainder of 1982 until early 1984, he killed three additional victims in this way (9-year-old Jos\u00e9 Nogueira Neto; 9-year-old Maria M\u00e1rcia de Lima Carvalho and 11-year-old Moacir de Silva), leaving their bodies in sugarcane fields. \n\n## Arrest and trial\n\n By May 1984, the murders received national attention, leading officers from Mar\u00edlia to compare them with the de Marco's first killing in 1953. After numerous similarities were found, a warrant was issued for his arrest and he was subsequently captured without incident the following month. An inspection of his home led to the discovery of a shoeshine brush used by Antonelli, as well as PVC pipes that were identical to the ones used to sodomize the boys and were later discarded next to the bodies. When queried for his motivations, de Marco simply stated that he \"sometimes lost [his] mind\" and went looking for children. His trial was held on October 31, 1984, and resulted in a 70-year prison sentence. What happened to him afterwards is unknown, but it is presumed that he is now deceased.", "Geolocation-based video game": "A geolocation-based video game or location-based video game is a type of video game where the gameplay evolves and progresses via a player's location in the world, often attained using GPS. Most location-based video games are mobile games that make use of the mobile phone's built in GPS capability, and often have real-world map integration. One of the most recognizable location-based mobile games is \"Pok\u00e9mon Go\". Location-based (GPS) games are often conflated with augmented reality (AR) games. GPS and AR are two separate technologies which are sometimes both used in a game, like in Pok\u00e9mon Go and Minecraft Earth. GPS and AR functionality largely do not depend on one another but are often used in concert. A video game may be an AR game, a location-based game, both, or neither. \n\n## Technology\n\n Geolocation-based video games use GPS. Games such as \"Pok\u00e9mon Go\" and \"Ingress\" also use an Image Linked Map(ILM) interface, where approved geotagged locations appear on a stylized map for the user to interact with. \n\n## Legality\n\n The nature of location-based gaming may mean that certain real-world locations will be visited by higher-than-normal numbers of people who are playing the game, which generally has been received favorably by nearby attractions or local businesses. However, these games may generate activity at locations that are privately-owned or have access limits, or otherwise cause undesirable congestion. \"Pok\u00e9mon Go\" notably has several publicized events of players being drawn to inappropriate locations for the game, requiring the developer to manually remove these areas from the game. In one of the first legal challenges for location-based gaming, a Federal District court ruled that a Wisconsin county ordinance to require game developers of such location-based games to get appropriate permits to allow locations in the county's public park systems was likely unconstitutional. While the county had felt there was no First Amendment rights involved due to how locations were generated in-game, the Federal judge disagreed. The interaction of location-bound augmented reality with property law is largely undefined. Several models have been analysed for how this interaction may be resolved in a common law context: an extension of real property rights to also cover augmentations on or near the property with a strong notion of trespassing, forbidding augmentations unless allowed by the owner; an 'open range' system, where augmentations are allowed unless forbidden by the owner; and a 'freedom to roam' system, where real property owners have no control over non-disruptive augmentations. One issue experienced during the Pok\u00e9mon Go craze was the game's players disturbing owners of private property while visiting nearby location-bound augmentations, which may have been on the properties or the properties may have been \"en route\". The terms of service of Pok\u00e9mon Go explicitly disclaim responsibility for players' actions, which may limit (but may not totally extinguish) the liability of its producer, Niantic, in the event of a player trespassing while playing the game: by Niantic's argument, the player is the one committing the trespass, while Niantic has merely engaged in permissible free speech. A theory advanced in lawsuits brought against Niantic is that their placement of game elements in places that will lead to trespass or an exceptionally large flux of visitors can constitute nuisance, despite each individual trespass or visit only being tenuously caused by Niantic. Another claim raised against Niantic is that the placement of profitable game elements on land without permission of the land's owners is unjust enrichment. More hypothetically, a property may be augmented with advertising or disagreeable content against its owner's wishes. Under American law, these situations are unlikely to be seen as a violation of real property rights by courts without an expansion of those rights to include augmented reality (similarly to how English common law came to recognise air rights). Some attempts at legislative regulation have been made in the United States. Milwaukee County, Wisconsin attempted to regulate augmented reality games played in its parks, requiring prior issuance of a permit, but this was criticised on free speech grounds by a federal judge; and Illinois considered mandating a notice and take down procedure for location-bound augmentations. \n\n## Concerns\n\n In a paper titled \"Death by Pok\u00e9mon GO\", researchers at Purdue University's Krannert School of Management claim the game caused \"a disproportionate increase in vehicular crashes and associated vehicular damage, personal injuries, and fatalities in the vicinity of locations, called Pok\u00e9Stops, where users can play the game while driving.\" Using data from one municipality, the paper extrapolates what that might mean nationwide and concluded \"the increase in crashes attributable to the introduction of Pok\u00e9mon GO is 145,632 with an associated increase in the number of injuries of 29,370 and an associated increase in the number of fatalities of 256 over the period of 6 July 2016, through 30 November 2016.\" The authors extrapolated the cost of those crashes and fatalities at between $2bn and $7.3\u00a0billion for the same period.", "Girmay": "Girmay is a surname.

The class-driven cross-town rivalry began in 1988, playing over the years to large  raucous crowds packing both school's 10,000 seat arenas. UD has declined to renew the contest each year since the 97-98 season. \n\n## Series Origins\n\n The Dayton Flyers team is a regional basketball power with  a long tradition of excellence going back to the early 20th century. UD is proud to represent the leaders and elite of Dayton. Few fan bases in the country rival Dayton's for passion  and ticket sales. Wright Sate basketball is a much younger program, playing its first basketball in the 1970's. Wright State built a scrappy fan following at the  Division II level with fast, aggressive teams and its 1983 National Championship. The coaches and administrations for both schools enjoyed close relationships leading to UD making a verbal agreement to play the suburban school once they moved to Division I. \n\n## Series Suspension\n\n Despite having a winning record in the series, UD has declined to renew the contest each year since the 1997\u201398 season. This change in posture resulted from new administration coming to power at UD that did not think as highly of the cross-town institution. Without an official reason for the suspension in the series, many theories have been offered in the press and around town. Due to the dramatic social gulf between the elite private school student body and the  working class state school, a considerable amount of resentment has grown around this  decision.

From 1857 he established permanent circuses in several cities. \n\n## Life\n\n \n\n## Background\n\n Hengler's grandfather, Michael Hengler (died 1802), was a rider and performer in Hanover, and moved to England. Henry Hengler (1784\u20131861), one of three sons who were circus performers, was a well-known tight-rope dancer at Vauxhall Gardens; in 1807 he was at the Olympic Theatre, and afterwards was engaged for several years by Andrew Ducrow. During this last period Henry taught the circus business to his three sons, Edward Henry, John Milton, and Frederick Charles. After leaving Ducrow, he joined Price and Powell's circus. \n\n## Early career\n\n In 1841 Frederick Charles was a violin and trumpet player in the band of Mrs. James Wild's theatre at Bradford. He was later the business manager of Price and Powell's travelling circus; but when they got into difficulties they sold their circus to him and his brother Edward, who for some years carried on the business with varied success. In 1847 Frederick Charles founded his own circus, performing in a tent during the summer and in temporary structures in towns during the winter. \n\n## Permanent circuses\n\n Hengler established in March 1857 a permanent circus in Liverpool, and erected buildings in Glasgow and Dublin in 1863, in Hull in 1866, in Bristol in 1867, and in Birmingham in 1868. He maintained companies that moved from one circus to another. During the summer of 1865 he gave a series of performances at the Stereorama in Cremorne Gardens, Chelsea. He purchased in 1871 the Palais Royal, Argyll Street, London, and converted it into a circus. Here, in addition to the usual equestrian scenes of the ring, he introduced spectacular pieces played by children. \"Cinderella\", brought out at Christmas 1871, was very popular. His Liverpool circus was rebuilt in 1876 in the style of the \"Cirque d'hiver\" in Paris. The Glasgow circus, originally in West Nile Street, moved to new premises in Wellington Street in 1885, and to Sauchiehall Street in 1904, closing in 1924. The London circus was rebuilt in 1884; it remained until 1910, when it was rebuilt as the Palladium Theatre, retaining part of the fa\u00e7ade. Hengler established a reputation for providing good entertainment. He himself never attempted any character parts, but was a great horse-tamer, and frequently exhibited his trained animals. He died suddenly at his home, Cambridge House, Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead, on 28 September 1887, and was buried at West Hampstead Cemetery. He left a personalty of \u00a360,000. \n\n## Family\n\n He married in 1846 Mary Ann Frances Sprake. After Hengler's death the circuses were managed by their two younger sons, Frederich Charles and Albert Henry. They installed \"sinking rings\", which were filled with water for aquatic displays. A daughter, Jenny Louise, obtained a wide reputation as an accomplished equestrian performer. \n\n## References\n\n Attribution", "Giro del Ticino": "The Giro del Ticino was a professional one-day road cycling race held annually from 1949 to 1968 in the Canton of Ticino, Switzerland.", "France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023": "France is set to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 in Liverpool, United Kingdom, with the song \"\", written by Fatima Zahra Hafdi, Ahmed Saghir, Yannick Rastogi and Zacharie Raymond.

Garad is a title, Jama being his personal name and Ismail being his father's personal name (who also has the title of Garad). Jama is the 2nd Garad of Jama Siad clan of Mohamoud Garad of Dhulbahante. \n\n## Biography\n\n Jama was born in 1971 as a son of Garad Ismail Duale Guled. He was born into the clan of Jama Siad (Jaamac Siyaad) of Mohamoud Garad of Dhulbahante. Jama moved abroad after graduating from high school. In 2007, militias of the Jama Siad clan, together with militias of the Baharsame clan, occupied Las Anod, which was effectively controlled by Puntland, in the name of the Somaliland force. Soon after, the main Somaliland force joined them. \n\n## Appointed as Garad\n\n On 2008, Jama's father died in Las Anod. Jama returned to the country and became Garad in 2009. Two people were declared Garad of Jama Siad clan, each taking office. One is Jama, of this article, who took office at Las Anod on June 22, 2009.

The SSC effectively ceased operations around 2012 and the SSC President announced its integration into Somaliland; the Dhulbahante rebel movement was taken over by the Khatumo State. In April 2014, Garad Jama Garad Ismail visited Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, as a traditional elder representing Khatumo State. In September 2015, the Khatumo government, pursued by the Somaliland force, held a meeting in Balli Ad. Garad Jama Garad Ali surfaced to attend, but Garad Jama Garad Ismail, along with many other elders, announced his absence. This effectively withdrew Garad Jama Garad Ismail from the Khatumo State. \n\n## Mediator\n\n In January 2016, Garad Jama Garad Ismail attended a conference on philanthropy and anti-corruption in Las Anod. In July 2016, Garad Jama Garad Ismail, along with Garad Jama Garad Ali, took a position against Somaliland while sending ministers from his clan to the Somaliland government. In October 2017, Khatumo State came to an end when President Ali Khalif Galaydh announced its integration into Somaliland. In July 2018, Garad Jama Garad Ismail proposed that the Somaliland government not be involved in the peace process regarding the inter-clan struggle that occurred in El Afweyn, while praising the Somaliland government for its work in arbitrating the struggle to date.

He was the grandson of noted psychiatrist Karl Bonhoeffer and the son of physical chemist Karl-Friedrich Bonhoeffer. From a young age, Bonhoeffer was interested in physics and chemistry, and went on to study physics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he received his PhD in nuclear physics in 1958 under the supervision of Arnold Flammersfeld. After his doctoral studies, Bonhoeffer was inspired by a lecture by Max Delbr\u00fcck to switch from studying neutrinos to nucleic acids. He received a Fulbright scholarship and went to the United States to do postdoctoral research in the lab of Howard Schachman at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1960, he returned to Germany to work with Alfred Gierer at the Max Planck Institute for Virus Research. He soon became the director of the institute, where he began researching axon guidance, the process by which axons of neurons grow and branch out to find their targets in the developing nervous system. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Bonhoeffer made a series of pioneering contributions to understanding the molecular mechanisms behind axon guidance. He developed key techniques that are still widely used today, and used them to uncover fundamental axon guidance mechanisms. His discoveries led to the identification of the first known Ephrin guidance molecules, as well as other axon guidance mechanisms. In 1984, Bonhoeffer became the director of the newly founded Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, a position he held until his retirement in 2000.

The fourth named storm, and first hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, and the first windstorm of the 2022\u201323 European windstorm season, its formation ended an almost two-month-long period of tropical cyclone inactivity in the Atlantic basin. Danielle remained over the open ocean as a tropical cyclone before dissipating off the coast of Portugal as an extratropical cyclone. The Azores and much of Portugal received heavy rain from the system. Overall, damage from Danielle was moderate. \n\n## Meteorological history\n\n On August 31, an area of low pressure formed along a decaying frontal zone over the central subtropical Atlantic. The disturbance quickly developed into Tropical Depression Five by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01, about southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and then strengthened into Tropical Storm Danielle six hours later. Benefiting from abnormally warm sea surface temperatures and light wind shear, Danielle became a hurricane around 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02, about west of Flores Island in the Azores. Later that day, the system slowed to nearly stationary as it was caught south of a blocking high, causing it to weaken back into a tropical storm by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a03, due upwelled cooler waters. Later, Danielle drifted westward, escaping its cold wake. This move enabled the storm to re-strengthen into a Category\u00a01 hurricane. Now moving through relatively warm ocean waters and experiencing low shear, Danielle attained peak sustained winds of by 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04, while located about west of Flores Island. Danielle moved northeastward for the next few days, weakening and at times barely maintaining hurricane intensity, before rebounding slightly on September\u00a07, when it attained a minimum pressure of . Deep-layer shear increased late that day, causing Danielle to weaken to a tropical storm by 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08. Six hous later, when located about north of Flores Island, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. From then through September\u00a010, the cyclone made a counterclockwise loop over the open ocean while interacting with a deep-layer low moving eastward from Atlantic Canada. It then moved eastward and southeastward while gradually weakening, and made a series of slow loops near the coasts of Portugal and northwestern Spain, before dissipating about north-northwest of Lisbon, Portugal, late on September\u00a015. \n\n## Preparations and impact\n\n Large waves and heavy rain hit the Azores. Extratropical Danielle brought heavy rain to mainland Portugal. Between September 12\u201313, 644 accidents were reported throughout the country. Many downed trees and flash floods were reported.

Dorey, who collected a female specimen resting on foliage as well as five male specimens patrolling the flowers of a firewheel tree.", "Hou Yuli": "Hou Yuli (\u4faf\u96e8\u5229, February 11, 1900\u2014June 23, 1989) was a Taiwanese cloth merchant and entrepreneur, known as a Tainan textile capitalist. He was one of the leaders of the \"Tainan Gang\" in the business community of Southern Taiwan, and alongside Wang Yongqing, the founder of Formosa Plastics Group, was known as Southern Hou &amp; Northern Wang (\u5357\u4faf\u5317\u738b). \n\n## Early life\n\n Hou Yuli was born on February 11, 1900, in Erzhonggang (now Renli), Beimen, Tainan in Taiwan. His ancestors had been fighting for several years over the burial site of a mausoleum there. His father, Hou Jiang (chinese: \u4faf\u6c5f), was a subsistence farmer who passed away when Yuli was four years old. He was raised by his mother, Li Gua (chinese: \u674e\u74dc), who had no formal education. Hou Yuli was eight or nine years old when he was enrolled in the North Gate Public School, but dropped out barely a year later due to the family's financial troubles. By the time he was eleven years old, he was working four different jobs, earning small salaries to help his mother support the family. \n\n## Business\n\n At 14, Yuli was taken as an apprentice by his uncle Hou Ji (chinese: \u4faf\u57fa) to work at his new clothing factory. After four years there he left the job to make his own living. When he was 20 years old and working as a cloth peddler, he married Wu Wuxiang (chinese: \u5433\u70cf\u9999) from Jiutougang, a neighboring village. In 1926, when he was 27 years old, he moved to Tainan City and reunited with some old relatives, though a year later they split up, with Hou Tiao (chinese: \u4faf\u8abf) operating his own business, Hou Pai (chinese: \u4faf\u6392) continuing to innovate, and Hou Yuli opening the Xinfuancheng (chinese: \u65b0\u5fa9\u8208) cloth company. When Yuli started out, he rented a house on Shanhang Street (now Puji Street), but he had a unique vision and was good at business, so after three years, he had enough money to buy a new house next to the Kaiju Temple, which was used as both a store and a residence. After five years, the annual turnover of Xinfuancheng reached 350,000. In the 1930s, he became a leader among cloth wholesalers in the Tainan area. Two years after the creation of Xinfuancheng, Hou Yuli travelled to Japan. He used a bank employee as an interpreter to purchase directly from Japanese firms, saving the transfer costs of Taiwanese intermediaries. Later, Yuli went to Japan alone without an interpreter. Although he didn't speak Japanese at first besides simple negotiation terms, working directly with Japanese cloth shops to purchase goods saved him a lot of money and created many new business opportunities. In 1931, a businessman surnamed Cai in Tainan downtown operated a weaving factory near Mazu Tower (Zhongxiao Street, Tainan City), which was badly managed and sought a transfer of ownership. Yuli took the opportunity to buy the factory and changed it into a Xinfuancheng textile factory that produced its own fabrics. Around 1935, in order to expand business opportunities, Hou Yuli went to Hong Kong and Xiamen to engage in cloth trade. As he was not familiar with business in those areas, he left with huge losses. Except for the reservation of cloth shops and cloth factory equipment, his capital was almost in deficit. It was not until shortly after the outbreak of the second Sino-Japanese war that Yuli's career came back to life. The war's outbreak affected the clothing industry greatly. The materials in the Japanese mainland were controlled and the black market prevailed. Yuli took the opportunity to travel to Osaka to buy controlled materials and trade with them in Taiwan and Japan. The profits of those few years were extremely abundant. With his newfound earnings, Yuli retreated from Japan and bought closed cloth shops, pieces of land in Tainan, and fish farms in Binhai, Beimen, Qigu and other places in the western district of the urban area. He managed fish farms as an enterprise and made greater income off of them than the land cost to rent. After the new government took power, it implemented a policy of \"land to the tiller\". All his Grade III cultivated land had to be released, except for the fish farm land. Later on, most of the fish farms would be re-zoned into urban areas (such as the western area of old Tainan City). In 1945, when the government of the Republic of China took over Taiwan, the Xinfuancheng Textile Factory immediately returned to work, becoming Yuli's golden chicken in the absence of other options. Yuli also took the opportunity to devote himself to research, constantly improving the design and quality of his assets so as to increase the value of Xinfuancheng products. In the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), Hou Yuli bought the house at No. 67, Section 1, Dihua Street, Taipei City, as the Taipei liaison office of the Xinfuancheng Cloth Factory, and engaged in lending and interest taking, as well as making a number of corporate investments. \n\n## Death\n\n Hou Yuli died in June 1989.", "Iswandy Ahmad": "Iswandy bin Ahmad, also referred to as YB Iswandy Ahmad, is a Bruneian advocate and politician who formerly held the position of Member of the Legislative Council of Brunei, under the category of People Who Have Achieved Distinction.

He would eventually decline the offer and accept one from a private school. \n\n## Advocacy\n\n With 28 cases confirmed, Brunei has the highest number of new HIV diagnoses in 2015, local media reported on 11 April 2016. According to the council's findings, Iswandy said that more persons participating in \"risky behaviors\" and increasing public knowledge of HIV were to blame for the increase in HIV diagnoses. The Ministry of Health's attempts to solve the issue should have more assistance from cooperation with other government agencies, he claimed, as the council is worried about the sharp rise in the number of cases. Increased education and awareness about HIV prevention should be a priority, especially among the most vulnerable populations, such as young people and men who have sex with other men. Youth were exhorted to increase civic involvement to pave the way for a more dynamic local government system as the second Brunei Young Leaders Convention (BYLC) came to an end on 8 August 2019. While youth advocacy has advanced recently, according to Iswandy Ahmad, a member of the Legislative Council and the chairman of the BYLC, there is still a lack of engagement in institutions at the local level such village and mukim consultative councils. During an interview, he stated: The second iteration of Brunei's inaugural human capital conference, INITIATE, would take place on 19 May 2022, with a focus on creating a resilient workplace culture in the new normal.

The AIDS council president was speaking on the sidelines of the event. Iswandy said that the council observed the rise in new HIV infections from two angles. The council does not specifically target any group with its programs, in addition. He continued by saying that their strategy has always been bottoms up, starting with local leaders and the community. Iswandy Ahmad, president of the Brunei Darussalam AIDS Council (BDAIDSC), stated that empowering volunteers to manage events and programs is one of the council's methods for bettering the lives of its constituents. The BDAC will support and direct the members and volunteers to execute a successful event, but they are free to plan and manage their own programs and activities. He clarified that BDAC enables volunteers to express their thoughts and wishes, and that BDAC will support them in accomplishing their goals on 11 February 2016.

It runs between Bramham Gardens and Collingham Gardens and was laid-out in 1884-85 as part of the Gunter Estate, developed in the nineteenth century by James Gunter and his descendants. Houses in the Mews are much smaller than in the higher-class streets adjacent and were used as accommodation for servants and stabling for horses. Later they were home to drivers and their vehicles, and from the mid-twentieth century were increasingly occupied by middle and upper-class families. \n\n## Origins\n\n Hesper Mews was laid out in 1884-85 as part of the Gunter Estate which was developed by James Gunter and his descendants in the nineteenth century. The origin of its name is unknown. The Mews are to the east of Earls Court Road and immediately to the south of Barkston Gardens which was built by the Gunters on the former Earl's Court House. The area was largely rural before the Gunter family began to develop it and the Mews lie on farmland formerly known as Four Acre Court Field and part of Great Courtfield. They are in the Earl's Court district of London, England, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and run between Bramham Gardens and Collingham Gardens and largely parallel to Bramham Gardens. There are three closes on the north side. \n\n## Character\n\n The Survey of London write that mews were of \"considerable importance\" to the Gunter Estate, with Hesper Mews the last mews to be laid out, in 1884\u201385, \"the biggest and finest\" and \"on generous lines\". It is one of the few mews on the Estate that is accessed from the higher status streets around it through a normal street entrance rather than through an archway. Nonetheless, the role of mews houses as accommodation for servants, particularly coachmen, with stabling on the ground floor for their employer's horses, is evident from the street plan with the houses in Barkston Gardens and Bramham Gardens, on to which the mews back, being much larger than those in Hesper Mews. \"The British Architect\" commented in 1886, with reference to houses in Collingham Gardens, with which the Mews were also associated, that the stables in Hesper Mews were \"quite out of sight\" of Collingham Gardens, reflecting the need at the time for rich and poor to have \"proximate but separate lives\". As the horse gave way to the motor car, the coachmen of London's mews were replaced by, or found new employment as, chauffeurs and drivers with the ground floor used as garages for their vehicles, but, in the mid and later twentieth century, as the original leases ended and London's mews became gentrified, mews houses were increasingly occupied by middle and upper-class families. \n\n## Notable residents\n\n Notable former residents include:", "Hypostomus pseudohemiurus": "Hypostomus pseudohemiurus is a species of catfish in the family Loricariidae.

The national and international press reported extensively on this geological event. After the collapse, only two limestone rock pillars remained of the Felsentor. The rock cliff consists of a relatively weakly compacted limestone, which lost its rock volume due to erosion by wind and weather and thus became unstable. The Island Archway was part of a series of free-standing limestone formations on the Great Ocean Road that includes the Twelve Apostles. As early as January 1990, another rock arch on this coast, the inner arch of the London Arch, had collapsed. The stability of these cliffs is short-lived in geological terms.

There are between five and thirty three spore bearing leaves, each of which grows up to long. This is the smallest \"Isoetes\" species in the region. The leaves have three well-developed groups of supporting tissue inside, giving them a firm texture. The air canals are poorly developed, with the adaxial canal ending before the end of the leaf. Each leaf has a small and delicate elongated appendage at its base. It starts of triangular, but often decays somewhat over time.  The sporangia vary in size and do not have a membranous covering. They are usually bordered by a narrow rim, with some of the cells being noticeably thicker and a yellowish-brown in colour. The older megasporangia are usually circular while the younger megasporangia are more elongated. The microsporangia have conspicuous gaps. The innermost micropsorangia are often angled due to pressure that has been exerted on them. While the species in this genus typically have white spores, those of \"Isoetes stellenbossiensis\" have a distinctive greenish tinge and become darker when exposed to water. The megaspores are spherical and have a diameter of . The microspores are more brownish than the megaspores and have a length of of and breadth of . A three-lobed corm remains during the dry season. It has a diameter of about and have a harsh texture. They are protected by black bud scales with three horny, prong-like teeth. They tend to be buried at a uite deeply, up to a depth of at least . The corm is covered in caps of old cortex, each of which will remain for several years. They are difficult to remove, even if the corm has been soaked. \n\n## Distribution and habitat\n\n This quillwort is found growing in the Western Cape of South Africa - between Tulbagh, the Cape Flats and Stellenbosch - at an altitude of up to . It is sometimes also found in the parts of the Northern Cape that border the Western Cape, although it has also been suggested that this might be a new species. It grows on waterlogged soils and seeps on granite outcrops. \n\n## Etymology\n\n The species is named after the Stellenbosch flats where it was first discovered. \n\n## Ecology\n\n This quillwort can form large colonies of thousands of individuals when conditions are suitable. In fact, in some places they may grow so densely that they may be mistaken for a fine-lefed grass. It can still, however, still be difficult to find these plants as they are small and often associate with other species. These species include the shrub \"Psoralea pinnata\" as well as multiple species of grasses, sedges and geophytes. This is a seasonal species. Plants die off as its habitat dries, leaving behind a corm. This species, dpes however, have the highest tolerance to a low moisture environment out of the South African \"Isoetes\" species, and is able to be fully terrestrial during the rainy season. It may even be found growing with highly drought tolerent species such as \"Crassula dejecta\", \"Aristea africana\", and \"Oedera fruticosa\". \n\n## Conservation\n\n In an assessment conducted in 2006, the IUCN classified this species as near threatened. It is, however, probably the most common \"Isoetes\" species in South Africa. An assessment conducted by the South African National Biodiversity Institute in 2020 classified this species as least concern as, while this species was still declining, the assessors believed that the population was still common enough with large enough subpopulations to not be at immediate risk of extinction.", "Ialtris parishi": "Ialtris parishi, the Tiburon banded racer or Parish's fanged snake, is a species of snake in the family Colubridae.

The vast majority of what is known of Herluka can be attributed to the works of Paul von Bernried, a German priest and friend of Herluka's, in his \"Vita Herlucae\" (\"Life of Herluka\", composed c. 1130/1) and in parts of his \"Vita Gregorii\" (\"Life of Gregory VII,\" composed c. 1128\")\". \n\n## Life\n\n Herluka devoted her life to asceticism, living in voluntary poverty and choosing to be celibate. She lived most of her life in the Swabian village of Epfach before moving to Bernried in 1121. It is speculated that she moved there possibly to flee a peasant uprising, some historians also believe Herluka moved to Bernried after the priest Sigeboto (a companion of hers) was appointed there. \n\n## Visions and opposition to unchaste priests\n\n Herluka was documented to have had several visions which directed her life as a holy woman. In one such vision Wikterp, the former bishop of Augsburg and a bloodied Christ appeared to her. Wikterp told Herluka that the suffering of Christ she was witnessing was caused by priestly immorality. As a result of the vision, she refused to attend masses or take consecrated bread from unchaste priests, including Richard, the local priest working in Epfach.

A group of German immigrants including George Schmidt and Frederick Ruoff founded the group as the Deutscher Uhrmacher Verein, or German Watchmakers Society, with all meetings and business conducted in that language. As a guild for working watchmakers, it offered life insurance and training to members. The Society switched to using English around the time of World War I to accommodate a more diverse membership, and was renamed the Horological Society of New York in 1930. After a high point in membership following World War II, the Society declined during the quartz crisis in the 1970s and 1980s. In recent years, as mechanical watches have once again increased in popularity, the Society has expanded and now includes members from all over the world. It became a 501(c)(3) organization and serves watch collectors, hobbyists, and researchers interested in horology, as well as watchmakers and watchmaking students. It is an affiliate chapter of the American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute (AWCI).

It was published in 1950 by People's Press Printing Society which also published for the \"Daily Worker\" for which Winnington was working as a journalist. The leaflet claims that an approximate 7,000 corpses of executed civilians had been hastily buried in a mountain valley close to Daejeon.

In May 2022, Lohan talked to \"Forbes\" about the deal: In August 2022, local media reported Lohan would be filming a new movie titled \"Irish Wish\" in multiple locations across Ireland the following month.

Her death was not announced prior to the episode airing, nor was the exit of Pearson after fourteen years of appearing on \"Doctors\". Charlie Clemmow reprised her role as Imogen Hollins for the episode with a voice appearance. Viewers were shocked by the unannounced shock death of Karen and expressed their sadness via social media. \"Birmingham Mail\" noted how the \"excellent episode\" had proved how \"Doctors\" is the best soap opera and many viewers hoped that cast member Chris Walker would be awarded for his portrayal of grief. \n\n## Plot\n\n Rob Hollins (Chris Walker) finds wife Karen's (Jan Pearson) dead body on their sofa in the lounge. He finds a travel adapter in her hand, which she had been given by Lacey James (Alice Christina Corrigan) for the world cruise that her and Rob were planning to go on. He calls for an ambulance, believing that she is just unconscious. Paramedics Patricia Morgan (Beth Fitzgerald) and Elliot Stephens (Tijan Sarr) arrive and inform Rob that she is dead, but he refuses to believe them. Dr. Sid Vere (Ashley Rice), Bear Sylvester (Dex Lee), Scarlett Kiernan (Kia Pegg) and Dr. Suni Bulsara (Rahul Arya) are on a night out, and due to agreeing that they use their phones too much, they put them in the centre of the table and agree to not pick them up. Rob calls Sid, but since Scarlett lives with the Hollins, she believes that Karen is just checking up on her and tells him not to answer. Rob then calls Dr. Jimmi Clay (Adrian Lewis Morgan), who arrives and tells Rob that Karen has died. Jimmi steps into the hallway to answer a call from Dr. Al Haskey (Ian Midlane), who cries when he learns that Karen has died. Once he is alone with Karen, Rob realises that Karen is dead and breaks down. He tells Jimmi that Karen would always say \"if wishes were horses, beggars would ride\" and then wishes that Karen had not died. Jimmi calls Maxine Palmer (Sherise Blackman), a funeral director. A cheery Scarlett then arrives home, not realising that Karen has died. Once informed, she starts crying and realises that Karen has left Rob a voicemail, which he plays. Scarlett answers the door to Maxine, telling her that it is a bad time, not realising that she is a funeral director. Rob says goodbye to Karen and she is taken away. He tells Maxine that Karen wanted to be cremated, with a huge party afterwards, which he believed he would not be attending since he thought that he would die before Karen. He then rings daughter Imogen (Charlie Clemmow) and informs her of Karen's death, who breaks down into tears over the phone. While Jimmi comforts a tearful Scarlett, Rob sits on the sofa smelling Karen's perfume and listening to her voicemail to him, where she says the phrase \"if wishes were horses, beggars would ride\". \n\n## Production\n\n \"If Wishes Were Horses\" was the final episode that \"Doctors\" filmed in 2022 before wrapping for the year. After wrapping the scene, Walker gave a speech in honour of departing co-star Pearson. He joked that despite the title of the episode being \"If Wishes Were Horses\" and the phrase having a meaning in the script, Karen had never actually said it in her time on the show. Walker got the cast and crew to give three cheers to Pearson, who burst into tears. Her departure from the series was not announced beforehand, and her shock death was a complete surprise for viewers. All that was hinted about the episode prior to airing was that Karen and Rob's night \"takes a shock turn\". Clemmow reprised her role as Imogen after two years away for Karen's death. She described it as the most challenging storyline she had ever done. \n\n## Reception\n\n Numerous media outlets wrote about viewers' teary reactions to the episode. \"Metro\" said that fans were \"utterly broken\" by the unexpected scenes, with writer Stephen Patterson agreeing that the episode was \"heartbreaking\". Describing it as a \"tragic twist\", Patterson noted how many viewers had taken to Twitter to vent their sadness and anger at Karen being killed off. \"What to Watch\" wrote similarly, noting how viewers \"couldn't stop crying at the shocking and devastating death of the much-loved character\". \"Radio Times\" highlighted that one viewer had \"never cried so much at a soap episode\" and another labelled the scenes \"traumatic\". \"Birmingham Mail\" noted how the \"excellent episode\" had proved how \"Doctors\" is the best soap opera; a viewer added that \"Doctors\" \"know how to tug at the heart strings\".

The album's production tends toward organic, not striving to dazzle listeners with innovative approaches, instead seeking to draw them into worship through simplicity.\" Kittle also mentions that \"Paris' voice continues to achieve greater maturity with each release. Her vocals are bathed in what seems a contradiction: confident humility. While her voice comes across as confident and strong because of years of experience and faithful use, at the same time her vocals contain a gentle humbleness as she acknowledges her need for God through song.\" Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms has stated that Paris \"has always included worship music in her repertoire and in fact her 'We Bow Down' is one of the most popular of all contemporary choruses.

It was published in September 2021 by University of Ottawa Press and is the winner of the 2022 Governor General's Literary Award for French to English translation. \n\n## Synopsis\n\n In the three decades it took to write \"History of the Jews in Quebec\", Anctil sums up Quebec Jewish history as a succession of migrations from Europe that carried with them the experience of an often painful minority. In the four centuries covered, the Jews of Quebec have showed a sense of belonging. The rights they systematically reclaimed and their sustained contributions have helped foster diversity in Quebec. With migration from different regions of the world, this continues today, making Judaism found in Quebec, and in particular in Montreal, unique from that found in other communities throughout North America. \n\n## Awards\n\n \"History of the Jews in Quebec\" won the Governor General\u2019s Literary Award for French to English translation at the 2022 Governor General's Awards.

In the Canadian Jewish News, Elias Levy writes, \"Historian Pierre Anctil has just published a masterful, comprehensive, and fascinating book, \"History of the Jews in Quebec\", in which he recounts four centuries of Jewish life in Quebec.\" Additionally Levy describes it as, \"A work that will go down in the annals of Jewish history in Canada.\" Ira Robinson included in Project MUSE, \"Anctil's \"Histoire des Juifs du Qu\u00e9bec\" presents the reader with its own unique perspective on the significance of the Jewish presence in Quebec and, in particular, the often fraught historical relationship between Jews and French Canadians.\" ", "Interleukin 15-like": "Interleukin 15-like (IL-15L) is an interleukin, a type of cytokine signaling in the immune system. It is a secreted protein of approximately 120 amino acids and related to IL-2 and IL-15.  Intact \"IL-15L\" genes are found in bony fish, cartilaginous fish, reptiles, and many mammals. However, in humans and mice only an \"IL-15L\" pseudogene is found. The location of the \"IL-15L\" gene in the genome is conserved from sharks to mammals and on a different chromosome than \"IL-2\" and \"IL-15\".  Bony fish (trout) IL-15L specifically stimulates the expression of type 2 immunity cytokines IL-4/13A and IL-4/13B (homologs of IL-4 and IL-13.), probably by stimulating ILC2 cells; this is quite different from the functions found for IL-2 and IL-15, including in fish. For mammalian IL-15L, a function has not been found yet. In both fish and mammals, IL-15L seems to be quite dependent for its stability on \u201cheterodimer\u201d formation with IL-15R\u03b1, and functions for fish IL-15L could only be found if partnered with (presented \u201cin trans\u201d by) IL-15R\u03b1 It is unclear why many mammals, and also birds and amphibians, lost IL-15L. It has been postulated that in fish the IL-15L cytokine resides at the beginning of a type 2 immune cascade, a function that in mammals is performed by cytokines such as TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33; none of these three cytokines have been found in fish, and their evolution in tetrapod species may have made IL-15L redundant.", "I Congress of the Communist Party of Italy": "The I Congress of the Communist Party of Italy was held in Livorno on 21 January 1921, following the split of the communist fraction at the end of the XVII Congress of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). \n\n## Background\n\n The Italian Socialist Party (PSI) joined the Communist International in 1919. Although the party had adopted left-wing positions against the First World War it nevertheless contained a broad range of political opinions. While the majority of the party was pro-Bolshevik by 1919, a strong reformist right wing remained within the party, led by one if its founders, the leader of the parliamentary group Filippo Turati. Giacinto Menotti Serrati, leader of the majority grouping in the PSI, had led the party into the Comintern but was nevertheless opposed to expelling right wing figures, fearing this would alienate a large section of the party\u2019s supporters. The uneasy internal arrangements of the party were upset by the II Congress of the Comintern in July and August 1920, which laid down 21 conditions for all parties to remain within the International; one of the conditions was that all reformists - such as Turati - were to be expelled. In September 1920, the left wing of the PSI secured approval for an agenda for its forthcoming XVII Congress signed by which proposed the complete and unconditional adoption of the Comintern\u2019s 21 points. \n\n## The communist fraction\n\n Within the PSI the two main leaders of the communist fraction were Amadeo Bordiga and Antonio Gramsci. They mobilised their supporters in the months before the Congress to follow the Comintern line and expel the right-wingers. The fraction agreed a manifesto-programme signed in Milan on 15 October 1920 by Bordiga, Gramsci, Misiano, Terracini, Bombacci, Repossi, Fortichiari and Polano. A few days later the fraction gained the approval of Zinoviev who, also on behalf of Lenin, Trotsky and Bukharin, underlining how it constituted the only support of the International in Italy. The motion that the communists intended to present to the Congress was ratified in a conference held at the Municipal Theater of Imola between 28 and 29 November, and for this reason it was also called the Imola motion. The text aimed at the transformation of the Socialist Party into a Communist Party, making it necessary to exclude all those who voted in the Congress \"against the Communist program of the Party and against the commitment to complete observance of the 21 conditions of admission to the International\u00bb. The Imola conference did not explicitly deal with the path to follow in the event that the motion remained in the minority at the congress, but the hypothesis of the split was already concretely outlined. \n\n## The PSI Congress\n\n The debate at the Socialist Party Congress took place in a particularly turbulent climate and interruptions and tumults were frequent. The International delegates, Khristo Kabakchiev and M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi, supported the motion from the Communist fraction, harshly attacking Serrati. Their support was not however sufficient to prevent the majority of Congress delegates from supporting an alternative motion from Serrati, emphasising the importance of maintaining party unity and rejecting expulsions. On the morning of 21 January 1921, the declaration of the results of the voting made clear that the Communist fraction\u2019s motion had not succeeded, while Serrati\u2019s opposition to expulsions commanded the support of the party. Bordiga therefore proceeded to formalize a split of the Communist fraction from the rest of the party. \n\n## The birth of the PCd'I\n\n The delegates of the communist fraction walked out if the PSI Congress singing of the Internationale and, following Bordiga, proceeded to hold the founding Congress of the Communist Party at the . It was a makeshift arrangement: the building, used as a warehouse for materials of the Royal Italian Army during the First World War, had no seats, and the delegates sheltered with umbrellas from the rain that entered through the broken glass of the windows and from the holes in the roof. The Congress was held over two sessions during the single day of Friday 21 January, and limited itself to giving the new party an initial organizational framework. The morning session hosted the greetings of the foreign delegates Kabakchiev, Rosa Bloch, Jules Humbert-Droz, Balfour, and Arvid G. Hansen and the interventions of Bruno Fortichiari on behalf of the Central Committee of the fraction; by Luigi Polano for the young people; by Ortensia De Meo for the women and four workers and trade unionists. In the second session, an agenda signed by Fortichiari was voted on which declared the Communist Party of Italy (PCd\u2019I) - Section of the Communist International established. This name would remain in force until the dissolution of the International in 1943, when the party re-emerged under the name of the Italian Communist Party after being forced underground in 1926 by the Fascist regime. The congress chose Milan as the headquarters of the party and, as its official organ, the biweekly \"Communist\". Finally the Central Committee was elected, consisting of Bordiga, Grieco, Parodi, Sessa, Tarsia, Polano, Gramsci, Terracini, Belloni, Bombacci, Gennari, Misiano, Marabini, Repossi and Fortichiari. The role of general secretary was not established, although it was in fact fulfilled by Bordiga. The establishment of the PCd'I was completed a few days later, on 27 January, with the Florence Congress of the , which decided by a very large majority to withdraw its membership of the Socialist Party to join the new Communist Party, under the new name of the Italian Communist Youth Federation.", "Hibiscus paramutabilis": "Hibiscus paramutabilis, the everblooming Confederate rose, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae, native to southeastern China.

Isaac Edge, a British immigrant, built the windmill in 1806 on the shore of the Hudson River, just north of the present-day corner of Montgomery and Greene streets in Jersey City, New Jersey. \n\n## History\n\n The Great Western Mill of Southold, Long Island is a Smock Windmill that was originally located in Brooklyn Heights and then moved to Jersey City before being purchased by Hampton Young and others. The windmill was a four-story structure that used wind power to grind grain into flour. The millstones and machinery used in the mill were imported from England, reflecting the technology of the time. Isaac Edge was an industrious man who built a successful business around his windmill in Jersey City. He purchased waterfront property near the present-day Exchange Place from the Associates of the Jersey Company and hired the Burmley and Oakes millwright firm to construct a seven-story octagonal brownstone tower on a 100-foot-long pier, for a foundation that jutted out into the Hudson River. The windmill was completed in 1815 and became a landmark for ships approaching the Hudson River from the Upper Bay. Edge's efficient business practices and quality milling process attracted customers from a wide area. Farmers from as far south as Bergen Point, northern parts of Bergen County, Manhattan, Staten Island, and Long Island brought their grain to be processed at the mill. Edge also ran a bakery at the southwest corner of Greene and York streets. \n\n## Iron Sails\n\n The Great Western Mill was a prominent structure that dominated the surrounding area. It had iron sails and a machine for hoisting grain and returning flour. However, after the iron sails were damaged by a strong wind, canvas sails were used instead. The mill was run by various owners over the years and had a building attached to the north side in 1846 where a steam engine was installed. The engine was soon abandoned due to its high fuel consumption. In 1821, a storm destroyed the canvas fans on the mill's wings. Edge replaced them with iron sails and rebuilt the dock damaged by the storm. However, in 1839, the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Co. purchased Edge's property and covered the pier with landfill to build its terminal at Exchange Place.  Hampton Young, Ira Corwin, George W. Phillips, and Giles Wells of Southold in 1839 bid and acquired the mill. They had it dismantled and transported to Southold Harbor where it was reassembled on the George W. Phillips lot on Pine Neck Road. \n\n## 1840 Move to Southold\n\n In 1839, the property was purchased by a railroad company, The mill was dismantled, parts labeled, and then shipped and reassembled at Mill Hill in Southold, Long Island. The Great Western Mill was a significant feature of the landscape on the George W. Phillips lot, located a short distance east of Mill Hill (now known as Willow Hill). The mill was unique in that its sails were made of iron, which was a departure from the traditional wooden sails that were commonly used in windmills of the time. Additionally, the mill was equipped with a machine for hoisting grain and returning flour, which was an innovative feature that improved the efficiency of the milling process. However, despite its innovative design, the Great Western Mill experienced some setbacks. At one point, the machinery for turning the dome was disconnected for repairs, and during this time, a strong wind came up and caused the arms to whirl uncontrollably. As a result, one of the arms broke, and the iron sails were badly damaged. After this incident, the mill switched to using canvas sails, which were more durable and better suited to withstand strong winds. Despite these setbacks, the Great Western Mill remained in operation for many years, under the management of various owners. Hampton Young ran the mill for a significant period, and later it was run by Phillips. The mill continued to operate until it was destroyed by fire on June 25, 1870. The windmill was in operation for many years, and old mill records indicate that in 1812, flour was selling for as much as $18 a barrel, which was a significant amount of money at the time.

On October 27, 2020, AI21 Labs launched its first product, Wordtune, an AI-based writing assistant that understands context and can suggest paraphrases and rewrites. Google named Wordtune one of its favorite extensions of 2021. In August 2021, the company launched AI21 Studio. In the same month, Jurassic-1, a natural language processing system, was launched with a token vocabulary over 250,000. In November 2021, Walden Catalyst announced an investment of $20 Million in AI21 Labs. Later that month, AI21 Labs completed a $25 million series A round led by Pitango First. In July 2022, the company raised $64 million in a series B funding round\u00a0led by Ahren with the participation of prof. Amnon Shashua, Walden Catalyst, Pitango, TPY Capital, and Mark Leslie. On January 17, 2023, AI21 Labs announced the launch of Wordtune Spices, a generative AI tool that generates a range of text options that can enhance sentences.", "A Couple of Joes": "A Couple of Joes is an American television variety program that was broadcast locally in New York City beginning in August 1949. It ran on ABC from October 27, 1949, until July 12, 1950. The program featured comedy, music, and participation by viewers. \n\n## Content\n\n Episodes of \"A Couple of Joes\" included singing, instrumental music, and segments with prizes for viewer participation. The latter included bringing in items like a mustache cup and high-button shoes; viewers calling in musical requests, hoping to stump the two Joes by naming tunes that they could not play; and hosts calling viewers with quiz questions. \n\n## Personnel\n\n Initially, Joe Bushkin and Joe Rosenfield were co-hosts of the program. Others featured included Joan Barton, Allyn Edwards, Beryl Richards, and Pat Harrington. Music was provided by Milton DeLugg's orchestra in 1949 and Mike Reilly's orchestra and Bobby Sherwood's orchestra in 1950. By the first episode of 1950, Warren Hull had replaced Rosenfield on the show.  The show also included Morgan, a basset hound who belonged to the producer. \"Life\" magazine featured the dog in a story and photographs in its March 27, 1950, issue, reporting that Morgan was a \"3-year-old pedigreed basset hound called J. J. Morgan, though his real name is Sir Guy Elwell\". On \"A Couple of Joes\", a voice supposed to be that of Morgan made jokes while people talked and bands played. The article in \"Life\" described those comments as \"a blend of critical disdain worthy of George Jean Nathan and Queen Victoria\". The dog also appeared on other TV programs. \n\n## Production\n\n The program originated at WJZ-TV in New York City and was produced by World Video, Incorporated. Producers were Ed Kenner and Allen Kent, and Bobby Doyle was the director. Sponsors included Blatz Brewing Company. Tom Shirley was the announcer. \n\n## Critical reception\n\n A review of the program's August 19, 1949, episode in the trade publication \"Billboard\" compared the broadcast to \"a chaotic dress rehearsal\". Reviewer June Bundy commented, \"Musical portions of the show were vastly superior to the giveaway portions\", describing the latter as \"all very confusing\". She complimented Bushkin for his performances on the piano and his work as master of ceremonies. In contrast, she wrote that Rosenfield's \"harassed expression, nervous mannerisms and heavy-handed attempts at comedy were embarrassing to both cast and viewer\".", "Al-Qaflah": "Al-Qaflah () is a sub-district located in Qaflat Othor District, 'Amran Governorate, Yemen.

It analyses the impact of modern warfare, especially airpower, on the natural environment. \n\n## Summary\n\n Hayward assembled a team of military and civilian experts in various disciplines to chronicle and analyze the effects of airpower on the environment. Their analysis highlights the fact that air forces now take far more care of the environment than ever before and that many air forces, even in less developed regions such as central Africa, have created strategies to minimize all harm and even to do environmentally beneficial activities. This book reveals that some military forces have nonetheless struggled to deal with these critical issues. Creating air bases and then later vacating them after intensive use has caused harm, as has the failure in airpower\u2019s first seventy years to create aircraft than can be repurposed or deconstructed with minimal environmental harm.  The book argues that, during both peace and war, air forces have far greater carbon footprints than armies and navies. They use potentially more harmful ordnance. Their targets traditionally include objects in or around population centers and the aquifers, waterways, soils, and food sources that sustain human life. Also, because of historic targeting trends that will continue for some years, air forces cause far worse harm to environmentally significant production, storage, and distribution infrastructure, much of it based on petroleum, oil, lubricants, or chemicals. \n\n## Reviews\n\n In 2013, the American Library Association selected this book as one of that year\u2019s \"Notable Government Documents\", an annual award list designed to \"recognize excellence and raise awareness of information resources produced by all levels of government and promote their use\". \"The Gulf Today\" newspaper called it \"innovative\" and a \"ground-breaking book highlighting the environmental impact of the world\u2019s air forces.\u201d", "Adafroptilum acuminatum": "Adafroptilum acuminatum is a nocturnal species of moth in the family Saturniidae first described in 2003 by Philippe Darge.

This can include sharing informations like E-mail addresses, usernames and passwords for social media accounts, subscription services, gaming platforms or other online services. \n\n## Reasons for account sharing\n\n Account sharing is a common practice, especially among younger users who may not have the financial resources to pay for multiple accounts or subscriptions. It is also commonly used among families or groups of friends who want to access a shared account or service. Another reason could be to gain special features that depends on a single account like special items in a game account. \n\n## Reasons against account sharing\n\n \n\n## Rule Violation and Restrictions\n\n Account sharing can also present several risks and challenges. For example, it can violate the terms of service of many online accounts, which often prohibit users from sharing their login credentials with others. This can result in account suspensions or even termination, and can cause users to lose access to important data or services. On the other hand account sharing can lose money for the service the account is being shared for. Google prohibits the practice, along with Facebook \n\n## Security Risks\n\n In addition, account sharing can also pose security risks, as it can make it easier for hackers to gain access to multiple accounts using a single set of login credentials.

He was also the member of Delhi Corporation in 1958.", "Algorithmic accountability": "Algorithmic accountability refers to the issue of where accountability should be apportioned for the consequences of real-world actions that were taken on account of algorithms used to reach a decision.  In principle, an algorithm should be designed in such a way that there is no bias behind the decisions that are made during its execution process. That is, the algorithm should evaluate only essential characteristics of the inputs presented, without making distinctions based on characteristics that usually should not be used in a social environment, such as the ethnicity of an individual who is being judged in a court of law. However, this principle may not always respected and on occasions individuals may be deliberately harmed by these outcomes. It is at this point that the debate arises about who should be held responsible for the losses caused by a decision made by the machine: the system itself or the individual who designed it with such parameters, since a decision that harms other individuals due to lack of impartiality or incorrect data analysis will happen because the algorithm was designed to perform that way.  \n\n## Algorithm usage\n\n The algorithms designed nowadays are spread out in the most diverse sectors of society that have some involvement of computational techniques in their control systems, of the most diverse sizes and with the most varied applications, being present in, but not limited to medical, transportation and payment services. In these sectors, the algorithms embedded in the applications perform activities of natures such as: The way these algorithms are implemented, however, can be quite confusing. Effectively, algorithms in general behave like black boxes, and in most cases it is not known the process that an input data goes through during the execution of a particular routine, but only the resulting output linked to what was initially entered. In general, there is no knowledge related to the parameters that make up the algorithm and how biased to certain aspects they can be, which can end up raising suspicions about the bias with which an algorithm treats a set of inputs. It depends on the outputs that are generated after the executions and if there is any individual who feels harmed by the result presented, especially when another individual, under similar conditions, ends up getting a different answer. According to Nicholas Diakopoulos: \n\n## Wisconsin Supreme Court case\n\n As mentioned before, algorithms are widespread in the most diverse fields of knowledge and make decisions that affect the lives of the entire population. Moreover, their structure and parameters are often unknown by those who are affected by them. A case that illustrates this well was a recent ruling by the Wisconsin Supreme Court regarding so-called \"risk assessment\" for crime. It was ruled that such a score, which is computed through an algorithm that takes various parameters from individuals, cannot be used as a determining factor for an accused to be arrested. In addition, and more importantly, the court ruled that all reports submitted to judges in such cases should contain an information related to the accuracy presented by the algorithm used to calculate the scores. This event has been considered a major victory in the sense of how the data-driven society should deal with softwares that operates making decisions and how to make them reliable, since the use of these algorithms in highly complex situations like courts requires a very high degree of impartiality when treating the data provided as input. However, defenders of concepts related to big data argue that there is still much to be done regarding the accuracy presented by the results of algorithms, since there is still nothing concrete regarding how we can understand what is happening during data processing, leaving room for doubt regarding the suitability of the algorithm or those who designed it. \n\n## Controversies\n\n Another case where there is the possibility of biased execution by an algorithm was the subject of an article in The Washington Post discussing the passenger transportation tool Uber. After analyzing the data collected, it was possible to verify that the estimated waiting time for users of the service was higher depending on the neighborhood where these individuals lived. The main factors affecting the increase in time were the majority ethnicity and the average income of the neighborhood. In the above case, environments with a majority white population and with higher purchasing power had lower waiting time rates, while neighborhoods with a population of other ethnicities and lower average income had higher waiting times. It is important, however, to make clear that this conclusion was based on the data collected, not necessarily representing a cause and effect relationship, but possibly a correlation, and no value judgment is made about the behavior adopted by the Uber app in these situations. In an article published in the column \"Direito Digit@l\" in Migalhas website, Coriolano Almeida Camargo and Marcelo Crespo discuss the use of algorithms in contexts previously occupied by human beings when making decisions and the flaws that can occur when validating whether the decision made by the machine was fair or not. The great evolution of technology that we are experiencing has brought a wide range of innovations to society, among them the introduction of the concept of autonomous vehicles controlled by systems. That is, by algorithms that are embedded in these devices and that control the entire process of navigation on streets and roads and that face situations where they need to collect data and evaluate the environment and the context where they are inserted in order to decide what actions should be taken at each moment, simulating the actions of a human driver behind the wheel. In the same article in the excerpt above, Camargo and Crespo discuss the possible problems involving the use of embedded algorithms in autonomous cars, especially with regard to decisions made at critical moments in the process of using the vehicles.

However, the introduction of this regulation could end up affecting the software industries and developers, and it would possibly be more advantageous for them if they would willingly open and disclose the content of what is being executed and what parameters are used for decision making, which could even end up benefiting the companies themselves with regard to the way in which the solutions developed and applied by them work.

An ADD is an extension of a reduced ordered binary decision diagram, or commonly named binary decision diagram (BDD) in the literature, which terminal nodes are not restricted to the Boolean values 0 (FALSE) and 1 (TRUE). The terminal nodes may take any value from a set of constants S. \n\n## Definition\n\n An ADD represents a Boolean function from formula_1 to a finite set of constants S, or carrier of the algebraic structure. An ADD is a rooted, directed, acyclic graph, which has several nodes, like a BDD. However, an ADD can have more than two terminal nodes which are elements of the set S, unlike a BDD. An ADD can also be seen as a Boolean function, or a vectorial Boolean function, by extending the codomain of the function, such that formula_2 with formula_3 and formula_4 for some integer n. Therefore, the theorems of the Boolean algebra applies to ADD, notably the Boole's expansion theorem. Each node of is labeled by a Boolean variable and has two outgoing edges: a 1-edge which represents the evaluation of the variable to the value TRUE, and a 0-edge for its evaluation to FALSE. An ADD employs the same reduction rules as a BDD (or Reduced Ordered BDD): ADDs are canonical according to a particular variable ordering. \n\n## Matrix partitionning\n\n An ADD can be represented by a matrix according to its cofactors. \n\n## Applications\n\n ADDs were first implemented for sparse matrix multiplication and shortest path algorithms (Bellman-Ford, Repeated Squaring, and Floyd-Warshall procedures).", "40th Cabinet of Kuwait": "The Cabinet of Kuwait is the chief executive body of the State of Kuwait.

It succeeded the earlier Abarth 205A Berlinetta and continued to use the Fiat 1100's four-cylinder engine. It also continued to use the naming practice started with the Cisitalia 202 and 204, which continued with the Abarth 204A and 205A. Design work started in 1954 and the car was first presented at the 1955 Turin Motor Show. A street-oriented version of the Spyder called the 208A, fitted with a panoramic windshield, was shown in 1954, as well as a Coup\u00e9 model with an airy glasshouse, called the 209A. Both of the street versions appear to have remained one-offs. \n\n## Design\n\n The all-steel body was designed by Felice Mario Boano and built in his workshop. Only an open-bodied, streamlined two-seater with a fin behind the driver's headrest was available. The design was asymmetric; disregarding from the fin the entire body was taller on the driver's (left) side. While the chassis was designed by Abarth, there was still some Cisitalia DNA in the design, as implied by Abarth continuing the Cisitalia numbering scheme. The chassis was a boxed platform design and used most of the Fiat 1100/103's suspension elements, replacing the Porsche torsion bar front suspension and the earlier Fiat 1100\u00a0E's rear suspension that had been installed on the preceding 204A/205A. One modification was that the 1100/103's leaf sprung live rear axle was coil sprung instead, and was modified to accept longer shock absorbers. The engine was tuned by the addition of twin Weber 36\u00a0DCO4 carburettors and new exhaust manifolds, delivering at 6,000\u00a0rpm. The stainless steel exhaust pipes protruded from the right side of the car. For the small headlights, flanking a single, central chrome bar, Abarth used two of the Fiat 1100 TV's central driving lights. In all, twelve examples of the 207A, 208A, and 209A were built. Most sources agree that ten were 207A (competition cars), while the two-tone, American-inspired 208A and 209A found no takers and remined one-offs. All of the 207As appear to have been delivered to the United States, where they competed sporadically. The ten 207As were all sold via Tony Pompeo in New York. The 208A and 209A were painted two-tone and equipped with panoramic windshields, creating a rather American look overall. Since the 207A was only fitted with two small driving lights mounted very low, the 208A and 209A were fitted with pop-up headlamps, a very early instance of this design. The exposed, double stainless steel exhaust on the passenger side remained. The 209A Coup\u00e9 has a glasshouse reminiscent of Franco Scaglione's BAT cars. \n\n## Competition history\n\n The 207A's first race was the 1955 12 Hours of Sebring, where it was disqualified (after having finished second in its class) due to what the marshals judged an irregular refueling. The car was not very successful in competitions due to its excessive weight and compromised suspension design.

The events, which were primarily organised by Ukrainian Sixtier poet Dmytro Pavlychko as well as other dissidents, took place in the southern Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts, and served as a form of demonstrating Ukrainian nationalism and support for Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union. \n\n## Background\n\n By 1990, assertions of Ukraine's separateness from Russia had become more overt. The dissident movement had formed into several organisations dedicated to strengthening Ukrainian culture (such as the ) and increasing Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union (such as the People's Movement of Ukraine). At the same time, the Soviet Union was beginning to collapse; the Baltic states and Georgia had declared independence. The Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine, adopted on 16 July 1990, gave the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic newfound separateness from the central Soviet government. In 1990, the dissident movement was seeking something that could bring opponents of the Soviet Ukrainian government together. Seeing an opportunity to act without rejection from the government, they expressed their desire to organise events celebrating the 500th anniversary of the founding of the Zaporozhian Sich, a proposal which was accepted by the government. \n\n## Events\n\n Though official celebrations began on 3 August 1990, informal activities had already begun three days prior. Celebrations on that day commemorated Ukrainian historian Dmytro Yavornytsky, who had studied the Zaporozhian Sich. This was followed the next day by a convocation of Cossacks from throughout Ukraine (including the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic). Official events on 3 and 4 August 1990 included a scientific conference dedicated to the history of the Zaporozhian Sich, commemorations of Cossack leader Ivan Sirko, and the placing of a memorial at Sirko's tomb. In addition to dissident forces, other groups were involved in organising celebrations. Dissidents from the Baltic states played a role in organising awareness and support for the anniversary. Members of the Soviet government also gave their approval to the anniversary, with soldiers of the Soviet Army in one instance helping to install the flag of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army onto a monument and in other instances installing toilets and kitchens for participants in celebrations. \n\n## March in Zaporizhzhia\n\n The largest and most significant part of the anniversary's celebration took place on 5 August 1990. Beginning on the island of Khortytsia, a march began travelling across the Dnipro Hydroelectric Station and into the city itself. An estimated 300,000 to 500,000 people took place in the march, including priests and Soviet dissidents. Other occasions which brought people to support the march were preservation of the Ukrainian language and environmentalism. \n\n## Legacy\n\n The events of the anniversary led to a renewed interest in the history of Ukrainian Cossacks. Since the anniversary, Ukraine's Cossack heritage has turned from a matter of debate among historians to something which is commonly-accepted. A number of Cossack societies have been founded in Ukraine since independence in 1991, owing partially to an atmosphere which was favourable to Cossacks brought about by the anniversary. The commemorations also led to the protection of Khortytsia's natural environment, with the island being granted the status of a national nature reserve in 1993. Attempts at furthering the status of Cossacks within Ukrainian society after independence continued, though they failed to make significant progress. Proposals to integrate Cossacks into the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the presidencies of Leonid Kuchma and Viktor Yushchenko failed to come to fruition, and Cossacks fell into internal divisions between Russophile and anti-Russian Cossacks until the founding of the in 2014 as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War.", "Abdul Aziz bin Haji Jaafar": "Admiral Abdul Aziz bin Haji Jaafar (Tan Sri Abdul Aziz bin Haji Jaafar) was appointed as the 15th Commander of the Royal Malaysian Navy on 1 April 2008.  \n\n## Life\n\n Jaafar was born in Sungai Udang, Malacca on 7 May 1956, joined the TLDM in December 1974, and was subsequently commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1977.

In 1863, Kerr Taylor had a farmhouse constructed on the property as a centre-point for his 203 hectare estate. The house was rebuilt in the 1870s by architect Matthew Henderson, into an elaborate country manor influenced by Anglo-Indian architecture. Recently widowed, he married the 18-year-old Sophia Taylor in 1865. The Kerr Taylor family hosted a wide number of formal social events at their property, including the first Mount Albert County Ball on 20 September 1877, an annual party for the children of St. Luke's Sunday school, and meetings of the Pakuranga Hunting Club. Alberton was the venue for the 1883 Citizen's Ball, held for Governor William Jervois and his wife Lucy. In 1890, Kerr Taylor died, while the Alberton house and farm were still highly mortgaged. Sophia Taylor continued to administer the estate, and experienced many obstacles as a woman landowner. Taylor continued to live at Alberton until her death in 1930. A portion of the Alberton estate was acquired by the New Zealand Government, which established the Plant Diseases Division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research on the site in January 1939. The site was chosen due to its variety of soils, and undertook research on how to protect crops against disease. The DSIR gradually took more of the Alberton grounds during the 20th century, through compulsory purchases as a part of the Public Works Act. Muriel Kerr Taylor, the youngest daughter of Allan Kerr and Sophia Taylor, continued to live at Alberton for the rest of her life. Much of the family had moved elsewhere, and Kerr Taylor children often spent summer holidays at the estate, or lived there while attending Mount Albert Grammar School.

Responsible for organising both the Simferopol resistance and resistance among ethnic Crimean Tatars, Dagci was captured and executed by the Germans in July 1943. Following his death, he was nominated for the title of Hero of the Soviet Union twice (in 1943 and 1966), with neither nomination being accepted by the Soviet government. \n\n## Early life and career\n\n Abdulla Dagci was born in 1900, in the village of K\u00f6rbek\u00fcl (now ), in what was then part of the Russian Empire. In 1924, he completed training to become a cadre of the All-Union Communist Party, and became head of the Massandra Winery combine. In 1932, he was appointed as head of the Balaklava District party committee. He later became head of the Yalta Raion party committee. \n\n## World War II\n\n Following the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, Dagci was involved in the evacuation of civilians from Crimea, additionally playing a role in the construction of a stay-behind network to serve as a basis for underground activity following German occupation. Shortly prior to the capture of Simferopol by German forces, Dagci fled with his family to the village of . From Stil\u00e2, Dagci and his family fled to Sevastopol, where they joined with remaining Red Army forces on the retreat. Shortly thereafter, however, the Red Army was encircled around Yalta and Dagci's family was forced to flee to the Crimean Mountains, where they met with the Soviet partisans operating in Crimea. Dagci and his sister joined the partisans, and were tasked with capturing the mayor of the village of , a mission they successfully completed. In September 1942, Dagci was placed as the leader of a group of ten partisans, including his sister, who were to establish an underground network in the city of Simferopol. The network was established in the village of , located outside of Simferopol. At this time, Dagci took on the nickname of \"Uncle Volodya\" (). Dagci's network was the largest in Crimea during World War II, encompassing members of the German security forces, hospitals, and the collaborationist local government of Yalta. It participated in the rail war and attacks on German military bases, provided supplies to the partisans, and collected 20,000 rubles, which were sent to the Soviet Union proper and used to build an aeroplane. Beginning in May 1943, Dagci's group began subordinating other partisan groups at the behest of the military command, which expressed its desire for Dagci to shift his goal towards convincing Crimean Tatar collaborators to join the partisans. As a result of Dagci's efforts, a member of , Baki Gaziyev, defected to the partisans. Gaziyev's defection enabled partisan forces to bring an end to the German blockade of the partisan-run airfield in the Qarabiy yayla mountain range. At its peak, Dagci's network included 35 or 78 people, and included several members of his family. According to , author of the \"Crimean Tatar Encyclopaedia\", two thirds of Dagci's organisation were ethnic Crimean Tatars. \n\n## Death and legacy\n\n It remains a source of dispute as to how Dagci's group was unravelled. According to \"The Long Way to the Truth\", a memoir by partisan Galina Skripnichenko-Korovyakovskaya, the partisan group fell after one of its members was arrested by the Sicherheitsdienst and divulged information to German authorities. According to the Crimean Tatar rights organisation Milliy F\u0131rqa, however, the organisation was destroyed from within by two pro-German infiltrators, Zoya Martynova and Tatyana Andreyeva. On 12 June 1943, Dagci and his family members were arrested by the Nazis. Dagci himself was executed on 26 June 1943, and five of his family members were executed by the Gestapo. Other members of his organisation were either tortured to death, executed by firing squad, or imprisoned at the . Following Dagci's death, the Crimean Regional Committee of the All-Union Communist Party petitioned to the State Defense Committee that he be awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. However, the request went unanswered. In 1966, another attempt was made to nominate Dagci for the title by 24 Crimean Tatar intellectuals, this time alongside partisan scout Alime Abdenanova (who was later awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation in 2014). Once again, the nomination was unsuccessful, this time resulting in said intellectuals, many of whom were supporters of the Crimean Tatar civil rights movement, being noted by the Soviet government as political opponents. In 1998, repatriated Crimean Tatars living in the village named a street after Dagci. In 2017, the Council of Elders of the Crimean Tatars of Alushta sent a petition to Sergey Aksyonov, head of the Republic of Crimea, requesting that a memorial to Dagci and his family be installed in his native village of Izobilne.", "Alexandra of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg": "Alexandra of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg may refer to:", "Agricultural Research Council of Nigeria": "The Agricultural Research Council of Nigeria (ARCN) is a Nigerian government agency coordinating and monitoring agricultural research to increase agricultural productivity for economic development.

His case is considered notorious due to his lenient sentences and his committing violent crimes after his early release. \n\n## 1990s crimes\n\n In late 1994, Rjabkov got into an argument with two brothers named Vladimir and Dmitri over debts and women. Angered by their interaction, he decided to kill both, enlisting the help of another acquaintance named Aleksandr Tronin. In early January, he bought a TT pistol from a friend named Yuri, and on January 15, he and Tronin lured the brothers to a forest near Kehra. Once there, Rjabkov fired two shots at Dmitri, before proceeding to shoot Vladimir three times, killing both. He and Tronin then hid the bodies. On March 26, together with his 24-year-old brother Deniss and 33-year-old friend Lev \u0160m\u00f5rov, the trio went to the AS Krooning gas station on Paldiski Road in Tallinn. Deniss acted as the getaway driver, while Rjabkov and \u0160m\u00f5rov went inside, ostensibly to buy cigarettes. They came face-to-face with two clerks, Aivar and Eeno, shooting the former non-fatally while the latter was hit in the heart, dying on the spot. Rjabkov and \u0160m\u00f5rov then stole 1,500 krooni and left. Aivar survived his injuries, but the bullet was left lodged in his spine. \n\n## Prosecution and sentence\n\n Four days after the murder, Rjabkov and all three of his accomplices were arrested and charged with the respective crimes after the criminals' car was linked to a recent robbery. Unable to deal with the pressure, Tronin hanged himself at his cell in solitary confinement on April 13, leaving behind a suicide note in which he implicated Rjabkov as the shooter and himself as the killer of two taxi cab drivers in unrelated incidents. Tronin's letter later aided the prosecutors in securing a plea bargain with Rjabkov, who confessed to the murders and attempted murder in exchange for a more lenient sentence of 15 years. His brother and \u0160m\u00f5rov, who both received 9 years imprisonment, appealed their verdicts, with only the latter succeeding in getting a small reduction of one and a half years. \n\n## Release\n\n Despite the protests of his surviving victim and the prosecutor, as well as the fact that he had a total of 23 infractions committed during his imprisonment, Rjabkov was granted parole in 2007, three years before his scheduled release. His parole conditions mandated that he keep a stable employment, due to which he spent most of the year working as an electrician. However, by late 2008, he suffered several personal losses, as he was fired from his job, developed an addiction to alcohol, frequently quarreled with his wife, his health rapidly deteriorated and his younger brother was murdered. Rjabkov soon moved out of his home and settled by Harku Lake, where he lived in a tent. On November 12, he was brought before the court to face charges for two misdemeanors - however, he convinced them that he was still employed and had agreed to seek treatment for his alcoholism, due to which the judges ordered him to be released. On January 9, 2009, he was detained for six days in relation to a rape case, but was again released due to a lack of evidence. \n\n## New murder\n\n Ever since his release, Rjabkov had befriended 35-year-old Valeri Kornat\u0161jov, a fellow murderer who had also been released from prison. The pair often drank alcohol together, soon befriending a 49-year-old man named Stepan. The trio often visited Stepan's apartment, sometimes accompanied by Kornat\u0161jov's girlfriend. There were claims that Stepan had made inappropriate comments about her in Kornat\u0161jov's presence, after which the latter had threatened his new friend if he did not quit. Between January 11 and February 3, Rjabkov, Kornat\u0161jov and Stepan were drinking at Rjabkov's tent near Harku Lake when they got into an argument. In their drunken stupor, Rjabkov and Kornat\u0161jov beat Stepan to death. They returned a few days later, whereupon Rjabkov dismembered the remains, stuffed them inside a plastic bag and then disposed of them in the nearby field. Kornat\u0161jov stole four golden crowns from the victim's teeth, which he later sold at a pawn shop. Stepan's remains were found on March 3, and ten days later, both Rjabkov and Kornat\u0161jov were arrested and charged with his murder. Soon after their arrests, newspaper outlets wrote articles expressing outrage at Rjabkov's early release, blaming the policies of the then-Minister of Justice Rein Lang, who had previously stated that he wished to reduce the number of prisoners to keep up with \"Nordic statistics\" of low incarceration. At their joint trial, neither Rjabkov nor Kornat\u0161jov was able to provide a concrete reason as to why they had killed Stepan, claiming that they had been drunk at the time. Their attorney eventually convinced the judge that the murder charge could not be proven, leading it to be reduced to manslaughter instead. As a result, Rjabkov was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment, while Kornat\u0161jov received 8 years, in addition to both being required to pay a high amount of krooni for the trial proceedings. \n\n## Imprisonment and status\n\n Following his imprisonment, Rjabkov was remanded to serve his prison sentence, with a scheduled release date in March 2022. He filed a petition to be released early in June 2021, but it was unanimously denied by the court, fearing a repeat of his previous crimes. No information about him has surfaced since then, but due to the passage of time, it is presumed that he has been released.", "Al-Sha'war": "Al-Sha'war () is a sub-district located in Hazm al-'Udayn District, Ibb Governorate, Yemen.

By its second season, it had 37 members, which made it one of the smaller senior clubs in Glasgow. The club may have had an association with the Ferguson, Shaw &amp; Sons company of oil and grease refiners, as one of the club's match secretaries accepted correspondence at the firm's Stockwell Street premises. The club was one of 36 admitted to the Scottish Football Association at the start of the 1877\u201378 season, which meant the club could enter the 1877\u201378 Scottish Cup. In the first round, Albatross lost 6\u20130 at Govan.  Albatross entered for the next two seasons, but lost in the first round both times; 4\u20132 at Petershill in 1878\u201379 and 4\u20130 at the much larger Alexandra Athletic in 1879\u201380. The club only played 9 matches in the 1878\u201379 season, with 3 wins, draws, and losses, and only 11 goals scored in those matches. Still only boasting 37 members, the club was the third smallest senior club in the city (along with Ailsa), and bigger only than Rosslyn and Union.
