Scarlett had emigrated from England and stated in a 1691 court that he had lived in Stafford County for more than 30 years, which record survived because the case had been appealed to the General Court in Williamsburg.  His plantation, which he called \"Deep Hole\" because of an artesian spring, was near the confluence of the Potomac River and Occoquan Creek, near both Belmont Bay and Marumsco Creek, not far from where Captain John Smith landed on one of his Potomac expeditions and which was frequented by Native peoples. That area split from Stafford County to become Prince William County in 1731, well after his death. Around 1655, Scarlett purchased 700 acres from the widow of Thomas Burbage of Nansemond County (who had remarried to Capt. Edward Streator). Then, in 1666, Scarlett and Richard Normansell patented 2,550 acres on what later would be called Mason Neck north of that confluence, in what split from Prince William County and became Fairfax County, Virginia about a decade after the split from Stafford County. In 1674, the Stafford County court divided the parcel (using Pohick Creek as the dividing line between Normanstone's and Scarlett's shares); Scarlett sold all but 320 acres of his share, along Pohick Creek, to George Mason on 10 March 1690. Around 1675/6, Scarlet had married a widow, Ann Green (widow of William Greene Jr., who was affiliated with Lawrence who rebelled in Bacon's Rebellion), and in his lifetime had given half his Deep Hole farm to his stepson Joseph Green. Ann Green Scarlett also had two daughters: Anne who married Edward Barton, and Lettice married Edward Smith (and had 3 children before being widowed) then remarried around 1695 to Burr Harrison (1668\u20131715). Anne Green Scarlett bequeathed the 740 acre Deep Hole property to her son Joshua Green in October 1696, and the rest of the former Normansell property to Edward Barton. When Joshua Green died childless, the property passed to Lettice Green Smith Harrison, who died probably in 1699, since Harrison petitioned the Stafford Court to become the guardian of his late wife's three children. In 1765 Lettice's great grandson John Hancock sold the property to Col. John Tayloe. Early in the 20th century, while the house had long vanished, the family' graveyard remained near the end of Dawson's Beach Road, about two miles from the former ferry at \"Woodbridge\" in what eventually became the Occoquan Bay National Wildlife Refuge.The Works Progress Administration noted gravestones for Scarlett and a relation with a mostly illegible name which referenced a 1698 death date. While the original historian thought the next most legible name was \"John\", modern archeologists believe that it was for his widow (\"relict\") since it mentioned a marriage as well as the 1698 death date, and no records indicate that Martin and Ann had any children together. In 1902 tombstones from the graveyard desecrated during the Civil War were found at the mouth of Occoquan Creek. By this time the farm had been acquired by John Lindsay Dawson (1877 to 1967) of Fairfax County, who raised cattle and wheat and operated a fishery, and used the two tombstones to delineate the corners of his farm on Occoquan and Marumsco Creeks. In 1950 the Department of the Army purchased 648.61 acres known as Deep Hole farm, and built the Woodbridge Research Facility (a/k/a/ Harry Diamond Lab), which was transferred to the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service in the early 2002.

He was the first Black president of the Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) a HBU in Virginia, from 1949 to 1959; a former Commissioner of Education and of Welfare in the Virgin Islands; and a former deputy regional director of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in San Juan, Puerto Rico. \n\n## Early life and education\n\n Alonzo Graseano Brown was born April 12, 1909, in Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, Danish Virgin Islands (now United States Virgin Islands). He and his sibling were primarily raised by their single mother, Caroline Louisa Brown. In 1917, the island became a territory of the United States, but there were not many educational opportunities. In 1923 at age 14, he left the island to attend a secondary vocational school and learn the trade of upholstery at Hampton's Academy in Virginia, a school affiliated with Hampton Institute (now Hampton University). He continued his studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where he graduated with a B.A. degree (1932) in sociology and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. While attending college, he changed his surname to his father's surname of Mor\u00f3n. In 1932, he married Leola \"Lee\" Rowena Churchill from Farnham, Virginia. They never had children. With the Rosenwald Fellowship starting in 1944, he was able to attend Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts; and he received a L.L.B. (1947). In 1950, Wilberforce University awarded him an honorary law degree (L.L.D.). \n\n## Career\n\n The National Urban League provided Mor\u00f3n with a scholarship to study at the University of Pittsburgh, where he received a master's degree (1933) in social work. After graduation he worked as a case worker at the Baltimore's Emergency Relief Commission briefly, where he was the first Black employee. Followed by working for Paul Martin Pearson, the first civilian governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. While working for Pearson, Mor\u00f3n was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the role of Commissioner of Education and of Welfare in the Virgin Islands, serving from 1933 to 1936. Mor\u00f3n had a very close relationship with educator John Hope, who had urged him to enroll in a training institution for housing management and offered him support. In 1936, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia to serve as the assistant administrator of the acting president Florence Read of Atlanta University (now Clark Atlanta University). While living in Atlanta, he managed a 675-unit housing project apartment building; he managed the John Hope Homes (or University Homes); and lectured on housing issues at Atlanta University. While he was still attending law school, he worked as a business management consultant for Hampton Institute, a historically Black university in Virginia. He had been the acting president of Hampton starting in April 1949, and moved up to the role of president in October 1949. Mor\u00f3n was the first Black president of Hampton University, serving from 1949 to 1959. During his time at Hampton Institute, the school was admitted to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Mor\u00f3n resigned as president due to issue with the school's Board of Trustees; they had rejected Mor\u00f3n's proposals for university fundraising, and the board had violated proper channels of administrative rule over grievances with faculty and students, happening during the period right before the civil rights movement. After leaving Hampton Institute in 1959, he moved with his family to St. Thomas. He served as the deputy regional director of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in San Juan, Puerto Rico from until his death in 1971. \n\n## Death and legacy\n\n Mor\u00f3n died on October 31, 1971, in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Moron\" (University of Illinois Press, 2007) by Hoda M. Zaki\".\"", "Geometric Origami": "Geometric Origami is a book on the mathematics of paper folding, focusing on the ability to simulate and extend classical straightedge and compass constructions using origami. It was written by Austrian mathematician and published by Arbelos Publishing (Shipley, UK) in 2008. The Basic Library List Committee of the Mathematical Association of America has suggested its inclusion in undergraduate mathematics libraries. \n\n## Topics\n\n The book is divided into two main parts. The first part is more theoretical. It outlines the Huzita\u2013Hatori axioms for mathematical origami, and proves that they are capable of simulating any straightedge and compass construction. It goes on to show that, in this mathematical model, origami is strictly more powerful than straightedge and compass: with origami, it is possible to solve any cubic equation or quartic equation. In particular, origami methods can be used to trisect angles, and for doubling the cube, two problems that have been proven to have no exact solution using only straightedge and compass. The second part of the book focuses on folding instructions for constructing regular polygons using origami, and on finding the largest copy of a given regular polygon that can be constructed within a given square sheet of origami paper. With straightedge and compass, it is only possible to exactly construct regular for which formula_1 is a product of a power of two with distinct Fermat primes (powers of two plus one): this allows formula_1 to be 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc. These are called the constructible polygons. With a construction system that can trisect angles, such as mathematical origami, more numbers of sides are possible, using Pierpont primes in place of Fermat primes, including for formula_1 equal to 7, 13, 14, 17, 19, etc. \"Geometric Origami\" provides explicit folding instructions for 15 different regular polygons, including those with 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17, and 19 sides. Additionally, it discusses approximate constructions for polygons that cannot be constructed exactly in this way. \n\n## Audience and reception\n\n This book is quite technical, aimed more at mathematicians than at amateur origami enthusiasts looking for folding instructions for origami artworks. However, it may be of interest to origami designers, looking for methods to incorporate folding patterns for regular polygons into their designs. Origamist David Raynor suggests that its methods could also be useful in constructing templates from which to cut out clean unfolded pieces of paper in the shape of the regular polygons that it discusses, for use in origami models that use these polygons as a starting shape instead of the traditional square paper. \"Geometric Origami\" may also be useful as teaching material for university-level geometry and abstract algebra, or for undergraduate research projects extending those subjects, although reviewer Mary Fortune cautions that \"there is much preliminary material to be covered\" before a student would be ready for such a project. Reviewer Georg Gunther summarizes the book as \"a delightful addition to a wonderful corner of mathematics where art and geometry meet\", recommending it as a reference for \"anyone with a working knowledge of elementary geometry, algebra, and the geometry of complex numbers\".", "Planet Fun": "Planet Fun may refer to:", "Qataraspis": "Qataraspis (meaning \"Qatar shield\") is an extinct genus of primitive arthrodire placoderm from the Late?

Mani believed that the teachings of Gautama Buddha, Zarathustra, and Jesus were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the \"Religion of Light\".  Manichaeism considers Zarathustra to be a figure in a line of prophets of which Mani (216\u2013276) was the culmination. Zarathustra's ethical dualism is\u2014to an extent\u2014incorporated in Mani's doctrine, which views the world as being locked in an epic battle between opposing forces of good and evil. Manicheanism also incorporates other elements of Zoroastrian tradition, particularly the names of supernatural beings; however, many of these other Zoroastrian elements are either not part of Zarathustra's own teachings or are used quite differently from how they are used in Zoroastrianism. Manichaeism claims to present the complete version of teachings that had been corrupted and misinterpreted by the followers of its predecessors Adam, Zarathustra, Buddha and Jesus. Accordingly, as it spread, it adapted new deities from other religions into forms it could use for its scriptures. Its original Aramaic texts already contain stories of Jesus. \n\n## Usage of Zoroastrian theoynms\n\n When they moved eastward and were translated into Iranian languages, the names of the Manichaean deities (or angels) were often transformed into the names of Zoroastrian yazatas. Thus \"Abb\u0101 d\u0259Rabb\u016b\u1e6f\u0101\" (\"The Father of Greatness\", the highest Manichaean deity of Light), in Middle Persian texts might either be translated literally as \"p\u012bd \u012b wuzurg\u012bh\", or substituted with the name of the deity \"Zurw\u0101n\". Similarly, the Manichaean primal figure \"N\u0101\u0161\u0101 Qa\u1e0fm\u0101y\u0101\" \"The Original Man\" was rendered \"Ohrmazd Bay\", after the Zoroastrian god Ohrmazd. This process continued in Manichaeism's meeting with Chinese Buddhism, where, for example, the original Aramaic \"qary\u0101\" (the \"call\" from the World of Light to those seeking rescue from the World of Darkness), becomes identified in the Chinese scriptures with Guanyin ( or Avalokite\u015bvara in Sanskrit, literally, \"watching/perceiving sounds [of the world]\", the bodhisattva of Compassion). The original six Syriac writings are not preserved, although their Syriac names have been. There are also fragments and quotations from them. A long quotation, preserved by the eighth-century Nestorian Christian author Theodore Bar Konai, shows that in the original Syriac Aramaic writings of Mani there was no influence of Iranian or Zoroastrian terms. The terms for the Manichaean deities in the original Syriac writings are in Aramaic. The adaptation of Manichaeism to the Zoroastrian religion appears to have begun in Mani's lifetime however, with his writing of the Middle Persian \"Shabuhragan\", his book dedicated to the Sasanian emperor, Shapur I. In it, there are mentions of Zoroastrian divinities such as Ahura Mazda, Angra Mainyu, and \u0100z. Manichaeism is often presented as a Persian religion, mostly due to the vast number of Middle Persian, Parthian, and Sogdian (as well as Turkish) texts discovered by German researchers near Turpan in what is now Xinjiang, China, during the early 1900s. However, from the vantage point of its original Syriac descriptions (as quoted by Theodore Bar Khonai and outlined above), Manichaeism may be better described as a unique phenomenon of Aramaic Babylonia, occurring in proximity to two other new Aramaic religious phenomena, Talmudic Judaism and Mandaeism, which also appeared in Babylonia in roughly the third century.", "Abid el gassad": "Abid el gassad () is a 1962 film directed by Kamal Attia and starring Huda Sultan, Farid Shawqi, Mahmoud Al Meleji, Tawfik El Deken, and Shafik Nour El Din. \n\n## Plot\n\n The film revolves around Abd al-Fattah, who steals a bag of money belonging to \"Uncle Amin\" while he is outside a shop where the saleswoman \"Samia\" works.

More generally, the local elections were held during an escalating wave of crime and violence across Ecuador, linked by many sources to the growing influence of drug trafficking activities in the country, which was one of the issues President Lasso had originally aimed to tackle via the aforementioned constitutional referendum.

In the field of sociology, she pioneered the study of race relations as the theme of her master's thesis in 1945. \n\n## Early life\n\n Virg\u00ednia was born in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1910. She was the daughter of Italian immigrant Giovanna Leone and the descendant of enslaved Black men Theophilo Bicudo. Giovanna was the babysitter of the raised daughter of colonel and senator Bento Augusto de Almeida Bicudo, Theophilo's godfather. With the support of Colonel Bicudo, Theophilo became an employee of the Correios and Tel\u00e9grafos, and later rose in the institution until he reached the position of director of a S\u00e3o Paulo branch. Virg\u00ednia studied at the Escola Normal Caetano de Campos, in the Luz neighborhood. After the Normal School, she took a course on sanitary education at the Hygiene Institute of S\u00e3o Paulo, in 1932. After graduating, she became an employee of the School Health Service Board of the Education Department, teaching hygiene classes in schools in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, where she became interested in Sociology. She started a course in Social Sciences at the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Pol\u00edtica in 1936 \n\n## Sociologist\n\n She received her bachelor's degree in Political and Social Sciences from the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Pol\u00edtica on March 1, 1939. In 1945 she earned a master's degree in sociology from the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Pol\u00edtica, defending the dissertation \"Estudo de atitudes raciais de pretos e mulatos em S\u00e3o Paulo\",\u00a0the first post-graduate work in Social Sciences in Brazil to deal with race relations. Her dissertation was recently republished and has as merit the refusal of racial formulations of biological nature to think of race as a social category. Virg\u00ednia Leone Bicudo verified that racial discrimination in Brazil was not only present in social relations, but it acquired a specific character: it configured a prejudice that minimized direct confrontation and prevented the development of consciousness about discrimination. Her study defends the thesis that the criterion of appearance based on whitening would constitute the main determinant of the opportunities for social ascension of Blacks in Brazil. She was a participant of the UNESCO Project in Brazil, coordinated by Roger Bastide and Florestan Fernandes, writing the report \"Attitudes of the students of the school groups in relation to the color of their colleagues\", published in 1953, in the periodical Anhembi, She was one of the first black female university professors in Brazil, teaching at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Santa Casa, and the Free School of Sociology and Politics. \n\n## Psychoanalist\n\n Virg\u00ednia Bicudo was the first psychoanalyst without medical training in Brazil. She began her analysis with Dr. Adelheid Lucy Koch, the first analyst accredited by the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) in Brazil. In 1937, she applied to become a member of the Brazilian Society of Psychoanalysis of S\u00e3o Paulo (SBPSP), being approved as an effective member in 1945. In 1962, she was elected president of the second board of the Psychoanalysis Institute, a position she would hold until 1975. In 1970, she began to analyze and teach a group of six psychiatrists in Bras\u00edlia (Caiuby de Azevedo Marques Trench, Humberto Haydt de Souza Mello, Ronaldo Mendes de Oliveira Castro, Tito N\u00edcias Rodrigues Teixeira da Silva and Luiz Meyer). The group was then taken over by the Psychoanalytic Society of S\u00e3o Paulo, becoming the first group of the current Psychoanalytic Society of Bras\u00edlia. Virg\u00ednia Bicudo worked in several ways for the diffusion of psychoanalysis in Brazil. She wrote columns in the press defending her ideas on the social function of the psychoanalyst and took part in the foundation of the Psychoanalysis Society of Brasilia. She also collaborated in the creation of the Revista Brasileira de Psican\u00e1lise (RBP).

Widely used in industry and academia, it has become a standard approach for describing complex mixtures. Since it was first proposed in 1990, SAFT has been used in a large number of molecular-based equation of state models for describing the Helmholtz energy contribution due to association. \n\n## Overview\n\n SAFT is a Helmholtz energy term that can be used in equations of state that describe the thermodynamic and phase equilibrium properties of pure fluids and fluid mixtures. SAFT was developed using statistical mechanics. SAFT models the Helmholtz free energy contribution due to association, i.e. hydrogen bonding. SAFT can be used in combination with other Helmholtz free energy terms. Other Helmholtz energy contributions consider for example Lennard-Jones interactions, covalent chain-forming bonds, and association (interactions between segments caused by, for example, hydrogen bonding). SAFT has been applied to a wide range of fluids, including supercritical fluids, polymers, liquid crystals, electrolytes, surfactant solutions, and refrigerants. \n\n## Development\n\n SAFT evolved from thermodynamic theories, including perturbation theories developed in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s by John Barker and Douglas Henderson, Keith Gubbins and Chris Gray, and, in particular, Michael Wertheim's first-order, thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT1) outlined in a series of papers in the 1980s.  SAFT was originally proposed in a 1990 paper titled \"New reference equation of state for associating liquids\" by Walter Chapman, Keith Gubbins, George Jackson, and Maciej Radosz, which, in 2007, was recognized by \"Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research\" as one of the most highly cited papers of the previous three decades. SAFT improved on earlier, over-simplified theories, which were based on hard spherical molecules that do not associate, by focusing on molecular chain length and association. \n\n## Variations\n\n Many variations of SAFT have been developed since the 1990s, including HR-SAFT (Huang-Radosz SAFT), PC-SAFT (perturbed chain SAFT), PCP-SAFT (polar PC-SAFT), soft-SAFT, polar soft-SAFT, SAFT-VR (variable range), SAFT VR-Mie. Also, the SAFT term was used in combination with cubic equations of state for describing the dispersive-repulsive interactions, for example in the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) equation of state model and the SAFT + cubic model and non-random-lattice (NLF) models based on lattice field theory.", "Molla Mehmet Karay\u0131lan": "Molla Mehmet Karay\u0131lan (1888 - 24 May 1920) was a Kurdish villager who famously fought and died in the Siege of Aintab. \n\n## Early life\n\n Mehmet was born in 1888 in a tent in the Elifler or K\u00fcrt Elif hamlet in the Besni kaza, Ottoman Empire, modern-day Pazarc\u0131k, Turkey, to a relatively affluent family belonging to the Kabalar sub-tribe of the Kurdish Atma or Reshwan tribe. His father, Mahmut, was a skillful fighter, earning him the nickname \"Karay\u0131lan\" ( \"black snake\"), which Mehmet inherited. In 1904, his father was killed by Armenian bandits raiding the hamlet.  Mehmet took Quran lessons from the imam of the S\u00f6\u011f\u00fctl\u00fc village in modern-day Malatya Province and became the imam of his own village. Because of this, he came to be known as \"Molla\". \n\n## World War I\n\n Molla Mehmet fought against Russia for the Ottomans during World War I and got injured on his leg. After healing, he became the leader of his tribe. He collaborated with the Ottoman government to track down and kill the infamous bandit Bozan Agha, who terrorized the region between Pazarc\u0131k and Malatya. \n\n## Participation in the Siege of Aintab and death\n\n Upon hearing of the French expansion to Aintab, Molla Mehmet gathered 82 volunteers from his tribe and sold his family property, against his mother\u2019s wish for him to stay. Defeating French forces marching towards Marash in Karab\u0131y\u0131kl\u0131 village, Mehmet was able to capture 50 French soldiers, which earned him great fame throughout Turkey.

", "Palace Carminali Bottigella": "Palace Carminali Bottigella is a noble palace built by the ancient Beccaria family from Pavia. The original structure from the Sforza era was built between 1490 and 1499. The fa\u00e7ade, which retains the original terracotta decorations, is one of the major examples of Renaissance civil building in Pavia. \n\n## History\n\n The first owners of the building were the Beccarias, who at least from 1348 held a fair amount of real estate in the Porta Marenga district. In 1695 the building was purchased by Giovanni and Flavio Carminali, a family of noble merchants from Bergamo, who had been present in the city since the second half of the 16th century. The Carminals moved their home here from their previous residence in Piazza Vittoria near the Church of Santa Maria Gualtieri. The new owners promoted important extension works of the house. The large Baroque staircase with two flights, adhering to the east side of the building, in fact bears the date 1696 engraved on the central pillar of the balustrade, adorned with 18 coats of arms. In 1763 the palace passed, by will of Pier Francesco Carminati, to his cousins Ottavio and Francesco Malaspina Giorgi di Sannazzaro and, in 1784, it was sold to Monsignor Antonio Picchiotti, the bishop's vicar, who in turn left it to his nephew Baldassarre Bottigella. In 1866, the residence was inherited by the Vicos and, after becoming the headquarters of the Casa del Fascio, in 1946 it passed to the Provincial Association of Merchants. \n\n## Architecture\n\n As regards its construction, attributions to Bramante and Giovanni Antonio Amadeo have been hypothesized. Some notarial deeds drawn up between 1491 and 1496 testify that in those years Andrea Beccaria and his brothers paid some Milanese stonecutters, Alessandro Bossi and Domenico Solari, then engaged in the reconstruction of the family's domus magna, and therefore probable that the current palace it replaced a previous stately home of the family (of which the tower remains, leaning against the western part of the facade, now trimmed and reduced to the same height as the building). The works for the construction of the building were however directed by the ducal engineer Martino Fugazza. The facade overlooking Corso Cavour is entirely in brick and was not completed, however, what exists is sufficiently indicative of the intentions of the designer. The surface, extended to two floors above ground plus one under the eaves, remained entirely in exposed brick, is divided into two parts by the large string course in terracotta, decorated with plant motifs with interspersed coats of arms and profiles of characters marked by a typically Renaissance taste. This string course is ideally supported by terracotta pilasters with marble capitals on the ground floor. And in turn it holds as many candelabra-columns, always in terracotta. Each of the backgrounds thus obtained (which perhaps originally should have been plastered) was intended to house a window, surrounded by a frame, surmounted by a decoration with fauns and bucrania, also in terracotta. However, only the two at the left end of the ground floor were completed, while on the first floor both the size and the arched shape that can be read in the traces of the original openings would suggest the intention of placing mullioned windows. This party can in part recall others belonging to palaces in the Po Valley but not in Pavia: above all Palazzo Mozzanica in Lodi and Palazzo Landi in Piacenza, both of which have a similar horizontal band dividing the lower area from the upper part, but have neither pilasters or candelabra-columns. The interiors were extensively remodeled between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and retain Baroque stuccos and frescoes, while in the middle of the great staircase, the fifteenth-century funerary slabs of members of the Bottigella family from the church San Tommaso are preserved.", "Hawley Hospital": "The Hawley Hospital was a specialist hospital in Barnstaple, Devon, founded in 1920 as a pulmonary tuberculosis sanatorium as part of a network of such facilities, instigated by the Public Health (Tuberculosis Regulations) 1912. \n\n## History\n\n The hospital was set up to take tuberculosis (TB) patients in the North Devon area, and was administratively linked to the Hawkmoor County Sanatorium near Bovey Tracey, with the building complete in 1920. Staff shortages in 1946 led to a restriction on the admission of patients, and led the Devon Public Health Committee to consider its closure. It joined the NHS in 1948, and was placed in to the Exeter Special Hospital Management Committee, which looked after the specialist TB, smallpox, and isolation hospitals. In 1949, 23 patients were admitted and 17 discharged, with two patients dying and 2 being transferred to other hospitals. The hospital was closed on 31 March 1963, with all patients and future treatment transferred to Hawkmoor Hospital. \n\n## Location\n\n The hospital was located on Sowden Lane, to the East of the centre of Barnstaple.

Sure, we hear that familiar Br\u00f6tzmann plaintive cry throughout, but the rhythms delivered by Drake and Gania are so mesmerizing... that this live date takes on a hypnotic atmosphere.\" Eyal Hareuveni of \"The Free Jazz Collective\" noted \"the tension between Br\u00f6tzmann's spectrum of contemplative, sometimes even lyrical playing and his wild swings and the one-dimensional, repetitive and trance-like rhythm section,\" and praised passages where the saxophonist's \"wailing answers cleverly the vocal phrases of Gania and often pushes the interplay to intense, ecstatic terrains.\" Critic Tom Hull awarded the album an \"A\u2013\", and stated that Gania \"centers this album, the jazz greats working around him, but also providing him with edges that lift him way above the merely exotic.\" Writing for \"The Wire\", Peter Margasak commented: \"the... partnership delivers magically shifting and embroidering grooves, digging into twangy, cycling patterns, and achieving a trance-inducing ecstasy where spontaneity feels preternatural.\" Phil Freeman of \"Burning Ambulance\" remarked: \"Br\u00f6tzmann is in a questing mood, emitting long rattling cries like a phlegmatic bull and only occasionally erupting into full-on screams. The music rises and falls like ocean waves or ripples in desert sand, seeming to have no beginning or end.\" However, he noted that \"Mokhtar simply lacks the aggressiveness [his brother] Mahmoud possessed.\" A reviewer for \"Avant Music News\" called the album \"a tuneful and challenging set of songs and improvisations,\" and wrote: \"Thumbs way up.\" \n\n## Track listing\n\n Music by Hamid Drake, Mokhtar Gania, and Peter Br\u00f6tzmann", "J\u00f6rgen Berglund": "J\u00f6rgen Berglund (born 1974) is a Swedish politician. he serves as Member of the Riksdag representing the constituency of V\u00e4sternorrland County.

She was the financier and confidant of Giuseppe Mazzini and promulgator of Mazzini's ideas and works. \n\n## Life\n\n Nathan was born in Pesaro in 1819. Her parents were Ricca Rosselli and Angelo Levi. At the age of eleven her mother died and she was entrusted to two ladies in Modena to complete her education. To avoid her conversion to Catholicism, she was then sent by her father to her maternal relatives in Livorno, a city that allowed a freedom of worship to Jews. Here, she met Meyer Moses Nathan, a German-born Jewish stockbroker who lived in London. They married, moved to London and became British citizens by 1837.  She met Giuseppe Mazzini in London in 1837 during his exile. She was attracted by his revolutionary and anti-monarchist ideas. In 1848, she began exchanging letters with Mazzini and she became his confidante. Her husband started a penny subscription scheme from his work contacts and 200 subscribed. An intermediary between the two was Pellegrino Rosselli, cousin of Sara and friend of Mazzini. He would later marry her daughter. The death of her husband in 1859 brought her a substantial inheritance which allowed her to finance Mazzini and his insurrectional activities. She returned to Italy with her daughter Janet as she needed a warmer climate. Dissatisfied with the monarchical outcome of unification, she acted as intermediary between Mazzini and Garibaldi in the hope that the country could become a republica as Mazzini desired. In a letter written to Garibaldi on 19 August 1862, she said that \"the homeland is safe if the two men whom Italy loves and esteems above all are united.\" She was charged with conspiracy. To avoid arrest, she and her daughter fled to Lugano, where in August 1865 she bought the villa \"La Tanzina\" which hosted, in addition to Mazzini, other Italians such as Cattaneo, Bertani and Quadrio. Mazzini stayed in the villa until 1871, the year in which she returned to Italy under a pseudonym and moved to Pisa in the house of Janet/Giannetta Rosselli, Sara's daughter. In March 1872, Sara Levi Nathan went to the house of the Rossellis in Pisa, where Mazzini was dying. Mazzini died in the Roselli's house.  At Mazzini's funeral, Sara took care of the coffin together with Aurelio Saffi's wife. In the following months she dealt with the publication of the works and all the writings of the republican patriot, purchasing all the manuscripts and all the rights to writings and works. In Rome, she founded the Unione benefica, a shelter to prevent the spread of prostitution and a secular girls' school in Trastevere and for this reason the target of criticism from many Catholics. \n\n## Life and legacy\n\n Nathan died in London in 1882 after surgery. She was buried in the in Rome where a memorial celebrates her and members of her family. In 1907 her son Ernesto Nathan was elected to be the mayor of Rome.

The opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU) declined to 43.2% and remained steady on 95 seats. The SPD's majority was ensured by the failure of the FDP to re-enter parliament: they fell just short of the 5% electoral threshold and lost all their seats.

Her father was set to become a Catholic priest but instead decided to move west with the Indians and work for the American Fur Company. Sophies mother and father died in the summer of 1851 when she was around 8 years old. Sophie and her two younger sisters were brought to the Iowa and Sac &amp; Fox Mission. The oldest two sisters walked to the mission on foot with the youngest being carried by a missionary. Sophie quickly adhered to the Christian faith being taught to her at the mission by Samuel M. Irvin and was quite devout until her death. Her health started to decline sometime after 1855 until her confirmed diagnosis of Consumption (disease) that would eventually take her in 1861. \n\n## Death\n\n On her death bed she spoke extensively about her fate to those who were attending to her in her final moments including her sisters. \"...I am done with the world; I am ready to go... I am going very soon, and I want all to be quiet and the room to be still and no one to cry or make a noise, that I may go quietly away and be at rest.\" In her final moments fighting against death, she spoke of band playing from the village even after being told that no such event was happening. \"Is not the village band playing this evening?... I hear delightful music... it is delightful, listen... I have now lost the use of one of my hands (it was cold in death) but if I could use it, I would raise it and clap both my hands for joy.\" in her last breath she spoke of Jesus coming to raise her up from the earth and then laid lifeless on the bed after the remark. \"Jesus is coming--they are coming--raise me up.\" It seems that Sophie knew of her demise far before the actual event by verses found in her bible cover that she had written before she bed ridden (shown below).&lt;blockquote&gt;\"Worlds should not bribe me back to tread Again Life's weary waste To see again my days o'erspread With all the gloomy past. \"My home henceforth is in the skies, Earth, sea, and sun adieu All heaven unfolded to my eyes, I have no sight for you.\"&lt;/blockquote&gt; \n\n## Sophie\u2019s contribution\n\n Before Sophie\u2019s death, she had 200 dollars that she had saved up from dividends from the tribe and those funds were deposited into a savings bank and trust in St. Joseph, Missouri.

Before obtaining the name \"Rubeti Hall\" it was often referred to as \"The Boarding house\" and the \"Indian Home\". Rubeti Hall was a girl's dorm until 1964 when it was converted to a boy's dorm and then was demolished in 1978 in order to build Culbertson Auditorium. Bricks from the fireplace of the dorm were used in a memorial outside of Irvin Hall in remembrance of the 110-year-old building that was razed and the girl it was named after. The memorial however does not use any of the beforementioned names opting for the name \"Rubeti Lodge\". \n\n## Sophie\u2019s ghost\n\n Whilst in use Rubeti hall was said to be haunted with residents claiming to hear sounds of disembodied footsteps and scraping chairs on the vacant 3rd floor.

As leader of the monastic order, he largely focused on internal matters, leaving foreign policy to Konrad von Wallenrode, who was appointed Marshal of the Order and Komtur of Konigsberg. He reformed the administrative structure of Teutonic Prussia, promoted German settlement, and attempted to found a university in the city of Kulm, though the latter never came to fruition. He also, like his predecessor, combated usery, reducing the maximuim interest rate from 10% to 8.33%, with violators having their capital confiscated. The city of Passenheim was granted city rights in 1386. During Konrad's reign, tensions between the Teutonic Order and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania escalated. Attempts to christianize Lithuania (which was one of the few areas in Europe that remained pagan) in 1383 failed, and although Lithuania adopted Christianity in 1386, relations only soured more as the baptism of Grand Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o was done to facilitate the marriage between him and the Queen of Poland, Jadwiga. This meant that Lithuania and Poland, who was the primary rival of the Teutonic Order, had entered into a personal union. In his later reign, the order was beset by numerous internal issues; in 1383, a plague outbreak occurred, and in later years, crop failures, and declining fishing and trade output wrecked havoc upon the state. Konrad died in Christburg on August 20, 1390. His body was buried in the Marienburg castle in the mausoleum of grandmaster under the chapel of St. Anne.", "\u0160luota": "\u0160luota (literally \"broom\") was a Lithuanian satire and humour magazine which was published, with hiatuses, from 1934 to 2004. Until 1990, it was published by the Communist Party of Lithuania and contained mainly Communist propaganda. It was the only humour magazine in the Lithuanian SSR and it was popular and well received. According to research of Neringa Klumbyt\u0117, artists and writers attempted to subvert the Communist ideology using the Aesopian language in the 1970s and 1980s. \n\n## History\n\n In 1934\u20131936, \"\u0160luota\" was published by the Lithuanian Communist Party. Since the party was outlawed in the interwar Lithuania, the publication was also illegal and appeared irregularly. The magazine was initiated by a group of students at the Kaunas Art School who maintained contacts with the Lithuanian Red Aid. The first issue had 16 pages and measured . A total of seven issues appeared during this period.  In 1940\u20131941, during the first Soviet occupation of Lithuania, it was published by the Soviet Agitprop and later by the \"Tiesa\" (\"Truth\") publishing house. It is suggested that the long post-World War II hiatus was related to the death of its editor, , who restored the magazine in 1940 and no one else had the energy to convince the Communist officials to restore it again. Until 1941, the magazine was published in Kaunas.  In 1956\u20131990, \"\u0160luota\" was published by the publishers of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Lithuanian SSR in Vilnius. It was a popular, well-liked, and profitable 16-page magazine published every two weeks. After the restoration of the independence of Lithuania, it was published by the company \u0160luota in 1990\u20131998 and by the company Piketo projektai in 2000\u20132004. In 1995, it was reorganized as a monthly newspaper. \n\n## Content\n\n The magazine published satirical, humorous writings, jokes and cartoons and caricatures on social, political, cultural and household topics. One or its recurring joke characters is Kindziulis.  The title of the journal reflected its revolutionary origins. It symbolized the intent to sweep away bourgeoisie, capitalists, clerics, etc. in a communist revolution. Issues published in 1940\u20131941 made fun of various \"enemies of the people\" and representatives of the old regime of President Antanas Smetona, including speculators, landlords, intellectuals, and bureaucrats. It also pointed out common problems of everyday life (such as laziness, wastefulness, alcoholism) and celebrated the new regime and building the new socialist society. Issues published after 1956 no longer focused on external enemies (i.e. bourgeoisie), but turned the satire inward and pointed out flaws of the Soviet society. The cast of characters now included drunk and procrastinating workers, Soviet bureaucrats, directors of factories and collective farms, but not party or government officials. \"\u0160luota\" received numerous letters from readers that complained or reported on various disapproved actions (such as alcoholism). In 1963, the office of correspondence received 2,234 letters, 230 of which were published.  \"\u0160luota\" devoted a third to a half of its content to cartoons and other illustrations. In the 1970s and 1980s there were around sixty artists who contributed to the magazine on somewhat regular basis. The artists were not members of the Communist Party and generally avoided contributing political or anti-religious cartoons despite higher commissions. Since it was easier to be ambiguous in a cartoon than in written text, some cartoons could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. For example, a cartoon of a tank aiming at the white peace dove could be interpreted as depicting either an American or Soviet tank. An ambiguous image printed as the cover for Lenin's 100th anniversary resulted in the entire issue being destroyed. Neringa Klumbyt\u0117 characterized such subversive actions as \"neither an example of clear collaboration, nor of open resistance, but rather a close interaction with power through dialogue, negotiation, acceptance, and rejection\". \n\n## Editors\n\n Magazines editors were:", "Kot Addu District": "Kot Addu District () is a district in the Punjab province of Pakistan.

By 1786, he had built a large house here. The acreage had increased to by 1798. After his death in 1812, the property was divided and passed through several owners. In 1872, David Dunham Withers, active in the horse racing industry, bought for his Brookdale Stable. In 1893, William Payne Thompson purchased the property. His son, Lewis, married Geraldine Morgan Thompson in 1896.

The district has 19 contributing buildings and one contributing site. Thomas Lloyd built his Georgian house in 1786. It was renovated and expanded in Colonial Revival style by Harry Whitney in 1914. The Lloyd Barn was likely built in the 18th century. It was later upgraded by Geraldine Thompson. The two-story Ten Mare Barn was likely built by David Withers in 1883.

It contains a single species, M. serbicus. \n\n## History\n\n The specimen was collected from Bela Stena, Suseoke village. The binomial nomenclature for \"Miodytes serbicus\" means \"Serbian Miocene diver\". \n\n## Description\n\n The holotype specimen of \"Miodytes\" is a slab that contains the right wing skeleton of the bird, nearly completed, consisting of the distal fragment of humerus, ulna, radius, carpometacarpus and parts of the wingtips (RGF 97/3). Due to the nature of the bones in the slab, the authors Dimitreijevich et al. (2002) used the humerus part and the carpometacarpus to provide comparative anatomy and a diagnosis. \"Miodytes\" can be differentiated from other grebes as the genus has a well developed epicondylus ventralis and a very deep and long sulcus musculi brachialis. The processus supracondylaris dorsalis is absent from the humerus. There are elements that are similar to grebes, petrels, and shorebirds from the specimen in which the authors proclaimed of the three groups, \"Miodytes\" is most similar to grebes. \n\n## Classification\n\n While Dimitreijevich et al. (2002) classifies \"Miodytes\" as a grebe, Ksepka et al. (2013) do not agree with the assessment. They are argued the diagnostic features that separate \"Miodytes\" from other grebes are more align with other seabirds. They stated there is no unambiguous synapomorphies that can confidently identify \"Miodytes\" as a grebe. Ksepka et al. (2013) argued at best \"Miodytes\" is a member of Mirandornithes, as it does have a strongly elongate phalanx II-1 which lacks an internal indicus process. More specimens are needed to established the taxonomic placement of this bird. \n\n## Paleobiology\n\n \"Miodytes\" is from the Early Miocene from the \"Bela Stena series\" from Valjevo Basin. The site is the oldest recorded lake formation with records of plant and insect remains, fish bones, and feathers. Fragmentary bird fossils have been retrieved but most cannot be identified at the species level. Inferring from the ecology of modern grebes and how the specimen was preserved, Dimitreijevich et al. (2002) suggested \"Miodytes\" was a migratory species and the individual died from an accident, not predation.", "Yelesen, Bing\u00f6l": "Yelesen () is a village in the Bing\u00f6l District, Bing\u00f6l Province, Turkey.

She graduated from Simmons University, where she studied political science, in 2011. \n\n## Historical interpretation\n\n McKnight works as a historical interpreter at locations such as Colonial Williamsburg, Genesee Country Village and Museum, Historic Richmond Town, and Museum of the American Revolution to teach people about the lives of African Americans in American history, particularly during the 18th and 19th centuries. She also works with museums and their staff to create resources and improve staff's ability to educate visitors on slavery and African American history. McKnight is a member of the New York Historical Society. McKnight began interpreting in 2013. Her first event was a reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg, where she portrayed a 22-year old free woman. As she began participating in more events, she became disappointed with how African Americans were portrayed or discussed, often only in relation to who owned them rather than their own internal lives and experiences. In 2014, in response to these experiences, McKnight founded Not Your Momma's History, which offered workshops of her own making for museums and schools. In 2017 McKnight officially began working solely on Not Your Momma's History. That same year, she staged a reoccurring work of performance art in Manhattan called #SlaveryMadePlain, during which she held a sign saying \u201cWhat to a Slave Is the Fourth of July\u201d while wearing historical dress. In 2019 McKnight was included in the book \"The American Duchess Guide to 18th Century Beauty\", where she spoke on enslaved people's dress and hair. In November 2020 McKnight dressed as an enslaved mother and stood outside the U.S. Capitol to call attention both to how emancipated African Americans struggled to find their relatives after the Civil War, and the separation of families at the United State's southern border. In 2021 McKnight was chosen as an African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund Fellow by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. As part of this, she created a project titled \"The Ancestor\u2019s Future: An Afrofuturist Journey Through History\", which was staged at the Woodlawn &amp; Pope-Leighey House as \"both a piece of performance art and a conversation inspired by Afrofuturism\". In 2022 McKnight set up a portable table in different locations in New York City a few times a month, and encouraged passersby to speak to her and ask questions about slavery and its history in the city.

It is distinct for its creeping growth habit and the prickles that grow on the flowering stems, which resemble a ladder. The specific epithet \"scalarium\" refers to the Latin word for \"ladder\". \"S. scalarium\" is a perennial spreading decumbent pale green shrub up to 30\u00a0cm tall. The main stem can grow between 4\u201312\u00a0cm tall, is woody and may branch 2\u20134 times. Younger stems yellow-green to tan-green in color and older woody stems eventually becoming dark tan or gray.

After a decade-long delay in his trial, he pleaded guilty to his confirmed crimes and was sentenced to life imprisonment, but remains the prime suspect in at least one additional murder. \n\n## Early life\n\n Little is known about Hobbs' past. Born in 1971 in Crosby, Texas, he is said to have come from a reputable family, but was considered a loner who mostly kept to himself. After graduating from college, he married, had two children and held a job as a security guard for a firm in Houston, where he still worked at the time of his arrest. He had no criminal record, but in 2000, he had been detained in the county jail for a couple of hours for a traffic violation. \n\n## Crimes\n\n Although investigators suspect Hobbs of crimes dating back to 1996, the first case he has definitively been linked occurred in August 2002. At that time, he picked up a prostitute in Houston and paid her to perform oral sex, but instead proceeded to rape, beat and violently choke her. This assault took place off the Beaumont Highway, near the San Jacinto River, where the victim was left behind. A couple of months later, he abducted 38-year-old prostitute Patricia Ann Pyatt from her home in Crosby, drove to an isolated area, then raped and strangled her to death. Her remains were found on November 19, beneath the Beaumont Highway bridge. A lull in known attacks then occurred from the rest of 2002 until 2010, when Hobbs is known to have assaulted a prostitute named Sandra Gunter near Houston. In October of that year, the nude body of 48-year-old Sarah Annette Sanford was found in a wooded area near his home. She had been handcuffed, sexually assaulted and shot in the head. Between June and July 2011, Hobbs is known to have attacked and sexually assaulted at least three prostitutes at gunpoint in and around Houston. On September 22, an officer from Pasadena who stopped by a brushy road to clock the speed of passing cars accidentally found the decomposing remains of 57-year-old prostitute Wanda Trombley, who had been reported missing in July. \n\n## Arrest, imprisonment and guilty plea\n\n The discovery of Trombley's body led local authorities to start questioning prostitutes, some of whom alleged that they had been assaulted by a large, red-headed white male wearing thick eyeglasses and a security guard uniform. Using this information, officers ordered all men who worked as security guards in the county to submit DNA samples, including Hobbs. This eventually linked him to the sexual assaults and then the murders of Pyatt and Sanford. The gap between the crimes led investigators to re-investigate the murders of at least 15 prostitutes around Harris County and the surrounding areas, as they believed that Hobbs was responsible for more crimes than what he had been linked to. Despite this and the fact that he was a prime suspect in the Trombley murder, no further charges were filed against him. Almost ten years would elapse before Hobbs would be put on trial - this was due to multiple delays caused by the search for reliable witnesses, damage from Hurricane Katrina and debates on whether he should face the death penalty. In 2020, the Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg announced that she would not be seeking the death penalty against Hobbs, but the reason for this decision has never been revealed. In May 2022, just days before he was due to stand trial, Hobbs pleaded guilty to all charges and was automatically sentenced to life terms with a chance of parole after serving at least 50 years, meaning that he could be paroled aged 101. The reason for this decision was supposedly remorse for his crimes and encouragement from his family. At the time, he was second-longest serving inmate in Harris County, being detained for only a slightly shorter time than another murderer, Lucky Ward. As of January 2023, Hobbs is detained at the Ramsey Unit in Rosharon.", "Lenehan": "Lenehan is a given name and a surname which may refer to:", "Neil Kearney": "Neil Joseph Kearney (15 March 1950 \u2013 19 November 2009) was an Irish trade union leader.

He was a prominent vocal critic of Buddhist nationalism, the military and military-backed organizations and businesses. He faced legal action in 2019 as a result of his public criticism of the military. \n\n## Life and movements\n\n The sayadaw was born in 1951 in Myingyan, Mandalay Region, Burma. He had entered monkhood after finishing high school with outstanding grades. At the age of 26, he earned the prestigious title of Buddhist scholar, a remarkable achievement that only 11 other monks accomplished in the entire 20th century. Myawaddy Sayadaw was known for his active participation in interfaith activities across Myanmar, often collaborating with Cardinal Charles Maung Bo. Alongside other influential Buddhist leaders in Myanmar, he participated in a meeting with Pope Francis to discuss interfaith relations during his visit to the country in November 2017. He has worked with peace and interfaith groups in Mandalay and with the National League for Democracy. In 2019, he was sued by the army for criticizing military donations of roughly 30 million kyats to the Buddhist nationalist organisation Ma Ba Tha, claiming that the military was sponsoring ultranationalist monks preaching hatred. He criticized the military, referring to them as \"robbers and thieves\", alleging that they disobeyed the president's orders, abused their power by intimidating civilians with their weapons, and unconstitutionally occupied parliamentary seats without an election. He also denounced Ashin Wirathu, a leading nationalist Buddhist monk, saying, \"He sides a little towards hate [and this was] not the way Buddha taught.

The Brawley took the form of a classic all-electric four-wheel all-terrain vehicle for a change. The vehicle is equipped with an extensive suspension system that allows for competitive driving on off-road, which is facilitated by 18-inch alloy wheels equipped with 35-inch tires with a thick profile and deep tread. It has a glazed roof and doors, from which the upper part of the body can be optionally removed. The minimalistic styled passenger compartment is distinguished by a triple arrangement of analogue clocks as well as a series of switches in the center console. Following the example of other models of the company, the steering wheel gained a three-spoke form. Production and sales of the Brawley was scheduled to begin in 2022, with reservations being collected just after the debut in July 2021.

It chronicles the life of J Dilla until his death in 2006, as well as his posthumous influence on the music industry. Described as \"equal parts biography, musicology, and cultural history,\" the book emphasizes J Dilla's signature rhythmic time-feel, which Charnas termed \"Dilla time,\" and its wide-reaching impact on modern music. The book debuted on \"The New York Times\" Best Sellers list, receiving widespread acclaim from critics and musicians. \n\n## Background\n\n In 1999, writer Dan Charnas met J Dilla and Common while the two musicians were working on Common's album \"Like Water for Chocolate\" at J Dilla's home studio in Conant Gardens, Detroit. Charnas cites this meeting as \"the real origin of the book.\" As an associate professor at the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University, Charnas taught a course called \"Topics in Recorded Music: J Dilla\" that discussed J Dilla's musical techniques and influence. He began work researching and reporting for the book in 2017. Charnas interviewed over 200 friends, family members, and collaborators of J Dilla throughout the research process. In the book, Charnas aims to dispel several myths about J Dilla. For one, according to Charnas, many musicians reduce J Dilla's time-feel as simply \"loose\" and \"not quantizing,\" but the book describes this as an oversimplification, detailing the nuances that defined J Dilla's technique. The book also debunks the misconception that J Dilla produced his 2006 album \"Donuts\" in the hospital, instead explaining that the album was born from an earlier beat tape and edited by Jeff Jank of Stones Throw Records while J Dilla was in the hospital. \n\n## Cover artwork\n\n \"Dilla Time\"'s cover artwork was designed by Rodrigo Corral. \"The New York Times\" listed it as one of the best book covers of 2022, calling it \"an image that signals the zones of [J Dilla's] many talents while nodding to the relationship between that talent and work ethic (and beats),\" also noting the exclusion of Charnas' name from the cover. \n\n## Reception\n\n \"Dilla Time\" was released to widespread critical acclaim, debuting at number four on the \"The New York Times\" Hardcover Nonfiction Best Sellers list. \"Pitchfork\" called \"Dilla Time\" \"easily the best rap book of the year,\" describing the book as \"not only a love letter to Dilla, but also a riveting immersion into the music of Detroit and the art of beatmaking.\" \"Rolling Stone\" listed the book as one of the best music books of 2022, describing it as \"elegantly written and deeply sourced.\" Writing for \"Spin\", Liza Lentini praised the book, calling it \"a portrait of a complex genius taken too young, as well as a glorious study of the music and culture he created.\" At the 2023 PEN Awards, \"Dilla Time\" won the PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for Biography. \n\n## Film adaptation\n\n On September 22, 2022, it was announced that Questlove would executive produce a feature documentary titled \"Dilla Time\", adapted from the book. The film will be co-directed by Joseph Patel, who produced \"Summer of Soul\" with Questlove, and Darby Wheeler. The film will be produced in cooperation with J Dilla's estate, with Dan Charnas also serving as producer.

His period as director of Aston Villa was fraught with problems and boardroom battles for power, most notably with Doug Ellis. Although there were major successes on the pitch under manager Ron Saunders during his tenure, in which the club won the First Division title in season 1980-81 and European Cup in season 1981-82, Bendall's regime was beset by controversy. He introduced his son, Donald to the board, and amid cries of nepotism Sir William Dugdale, Alan Smith and Harry Cressman resigned in protest. This was then followed by a power struggle with Doug Ellis and Eric Houghton. This boardroom struggle was eventually won by the Bendall's who bought out the Ellis shares in 1979 to give them a 42% holding in the club. To the surprise of commentators and fans, Ron Saunders quit halfway through the 1981\u201382 season, with Villa in the quarter final of the European Cup. Saunders had expressed his exasperation with the board at the lack of funds available to him to strengthen the team and fell out with the chairman Ron Bendall over the terms of his contract. Bendall cancelled the managers 'rollover' clause that would guarantee him a three-year pay-off in the event of his being sacked. Saunders was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager Tony Barton who guided the club to a 1\u20130 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam courtesy of a Peter Withe goal in the 67th minute, making Villa only the fourth English club to lift the European Cup. Due to ill-health, Bendall sold his shares back to Doug Ellis in November 1982. The club was saddled with significant debts and questions had been raised by the police regarding fraudulent financial activity surrounding the building of the North Stand at Villa Park from 1980-82. The cost of the work was \u00a31.3\u00a0million. An internal investigation found that \u00a3700,000 of the \u00a31.3\u00a0million worth of bills were unaccounted for.

", "Morgan Grace": "Morgan Grace may refer to:", "Bryconops rheoruber": "Bryconops rheoruber is a species of freshwater fish from the rivers of Brazil. Its back scales are tan-to-cream, and its belly is silvery; the divide between the two colors is marked by a broad iridescent-silver stripe. Its fins are a mixture of pale, clear, and reddish, which contributed to its specific name. \"Rheo\" means \"flow\" or \"current\" in Greek, and \"ruber\" means \"red\" in Latin. It was first described from the rapids of the Rio Xingu (hence \"rheo\" in its scientific name), and its range is known to extend into the Rio Iriri, the largest tributary therein. Like many other species of \"Bryconops\", it prefers fast-flowing waters over a rocky or sandy substrate. \n\n## Description\n\n \"Bryconops rheoruber\" ranges from 4.61 to 5.49 cm in standard length. This makes it smaller than most \"Bryconops\", members of which are largely between 6 and 8 cm long. It is deep-chested, with its deepest body section just before the dorsal fin, and it has 8\u20139 pre-dorsal scales; the latter is a feature it only shares with \"B. marabaixo\" and \"B. chernoffi\". Unlike several other species of \"Bryconops\", \"B. rheoruber\" lacks a humeral spot (a mark near either pectoral fin). Many fish in Bryconops have either one humeral spot or two. \"Bryconops rheoruber\" has a broad, iridescent-silver lateral stripe that turns lead-gray when a deceased specimen is preserved in alcohol. The scales themselves are tan-to-cream dorsally and silver ventrally in life, with all scales turning pale-yellow upon preservation. Some specimens may have an isolated blotch of pigment upon the distal portion of the caudal fin's dorsal lobe; this is superficially similar to coloration seen in congener \"B. florenceae\", though in \"B. florenceae\" the pigmentation is limited to the base of the dorsal lobe and the distal regions are left pale. The other fins are somewhat varied in coloration. The dorsal fin may have a diffuse, red crescent arching backwards from the center of the base to the outer fin-rays, which leaves a half-oval patch of hyaline dorsal fin near the base, and the tip is whitish. The adipose fin is red. The dorsal half of the caudal fin has a diffuse red ocellus (eyespot) near the base, terminating about midway down the lobe, and the tip of both lobes therein is dusky, sometimes with a darkly-pigmented dorsal tip. The anal, pelvic, and pectoral fins are mostly hyaline (clear). \n\n## Sexual dimorphism\n\n Mature males of \"B. rheoruber\" sport bony hooks on the rays of the anal and pelvic fins. These hooks are pointed back towards the body. Many members of \"Bryconops\" display similar hooks or spines, though appearance varies based on species. \n\n## Taxonomy\n\n There are two subgenera in \"Bryconops\", \"Bryconops\" and \"Creatochanes\". \"B. rheoruber\" has been considered a member of subgenus \"Bryconops\" since its description in 2019, based on the fact that its maxillaries lack teeth or have a single conical tooth isolated to either side. Members of \"Creatochanes\" are partially characterized by having one to three teeth on both sides, and also by factors like jaw length and the bones surrounding the eyes. \n\n## Etymology\n\n \"Rheo\" means \"flow\" or \"current\" in Greek, and \"ruber\" means \"red\" in Latin (compare the word \"ruby\"); respectively, these reflect \"B. rheoruber's\" preference for waters with a strong current, and the red coloration prominent in various fins. When originally named, \"B. rheoruber\" was named \"B. rheorubrum\". However, this was changed to be \"rheoruber\" because the genus name \"Bryconops\" is considered masculine by Latin gender rules, and convention states that the species and genus name match genders. \"Rheorubrum\" would be spelled \"rheoruber\" when paired with the masculine genus name. \n\n## Habitat and ecology\n\n \"Bryconops rheoruber\" was originally collected from the clearwater rapids of the Rio Xingu (pronounced sheen-GOO), and is also native to the Rio Iriri, the largest tributary of the Rio Xingu. Its natural habitat classifies it as \"rheophilic\", a word meaning \"living in flowing water or strong current\". This preference for clearwater rapids is demonstrated by other members of \"Bryconops\", even those that are not found in the Xingu. Examples include \"B. piracolina\", from the Igarape Piracolina; \"B. tocantinensis\", from the Rio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o; \"B. caudomaculatus\", from the Orinoco and Amazon River basins; and \"B. magoi\", from the rivers of Venezuela. \n\n## Conservation status\n\n \"Bryconops rheoruber\" has not been evaluated by the IUCN. Nonetheless, there are various factors affecting its surrounding environment that may both help and hinder its survival as a species. The Rio Xingu has been subjected to various infrastructure projects over the years, the most prominent of which was the construction of the Belo Monte Dam, the world's third-largest hydroelectric dam. This significantly altered the flow of the rapids in regions of the Xingu, threatening the environments therein. The establishment of the Xingu Indigenous Park, created in 1961, has helped to protect the territory not only of various endemic fish species, but also of various cultures and peoples that have lived in the area dating back to the 1200s.

(Original description) The shell is very long and slender. It contains about ten rounded whorls. The first two are turbinate, smooth. The third shows ten or twelve close-set vertical riblets, crossed by eight or ten revolving ones, the vertical gradually increasing to twenty-six on the body whorl, forming a close beaded sculpture as far as the middle of body-whorl, while the revolving ribs continue alone on the body to the siphonal canal. It varies also in relative strength of the two series of riblets, at different portions of the spire. The sinus is close to the suture The siphonal canal is straight.

The term \"sinus tarsi syndrome\" can also refer to swelling of the subtalar joint. The condition is somewhat poorly understood. \n\n## Causes\n\n Sinus tarsi syndrome can have a variety of causes, such as: \n\n## Symptoms\n\n Sinus tarsi syndrome is characterized by pain, tenderness, and instability/aggravation of the pain when walking on uneven surfaces or during weight bearing activity. The pain will be also aggravated by inversion (turning in) and eversion (turning out). Looseness of the ankle and foot joints can also occur. There is also often the presence of ligament tears, arthrofibrosis, ganglion cysts, or degeneration of the joints. Occasionally, peroneal spasms, valgus hindfoot, and limited varus motion can also be present. \n\n## Diagnosis\n\n X-ray can show some impingement in the sinus tarsi area. Other diagnostic tests include: bone scans, CT scans, and MRI evaluation. Doctors may inject local anesthetic to localize the problem to the sinus tarsi. Radiopharmaceuticals can also be used to identify inflammation. Ankle arthroscopy may also be used to locate damaged tissue. Diagnosis is often a process of elimination as sinus tarsi syndrome is rarely a definitive disorder. \n\n## Treatment\n\n \n\n## Conservative treatments\n\n Conservative (non-surgical) treatments are often considered first. Possible treatments include: Resistant cases may require more invasive treatments such as: \n\n## Surgical treatments\n\n Surgical treatments are very rare and reserved for highly resistant cases. Surgery can be open (via an incision) or closed (via arthroscopy). In cases of flatfoot, sinus tarsi syndrome is complicated by the collapse of the arches. In these cases, surgery includes debridement (cleaning out) of the sinus tarsi and possible reconstruction of the foot. Surgery can also include debridement of bone spurs as well. \n\n## Prognosis\n\n If treated, sinus tarsi syndrome has an excellent prognosis. Full recovery is to be expected, though some patients will need rehabilitation. However, relapse can occasionally occur, especially if only conservative treatments are undergone. Sinus tarsi syndrome can be misdiagnosed as a chronic ankle sprain. Untreated sinus tarsi syndrome can develop into chronic ankle pain and disability. \n\n## History\n\n Sinus tarsi syndrome was first studied by Dr. Denis O'Connor in 1957. O'Connor claimed conservative treatment was ineffective and surgery was the only effective option, describing a surgery in which the surgeon resects the superficial ligamentous floor and cleans out the fat pad. O'Connor claimed all 14 patients this surgery was performed on reported relief of their symptoms.

The use of concrete (an industrial material) by LeWitt is a recognition of and a reflection of the artwork's urban setting. Several private donors assisted by the High Museum of Art made this gift to the people of Fulton County possible.

The ecoregion extends south from the Bay of All Saints (about 15 degrees south latitude) to Cabo Frio (about 23 degrees south latitude) just east of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The Brazil Current enters from the east, feeding warm subtropical water to the south along the coast. The influence of the tropical waters leaves the ecoregion relatively oligotrophic (nutrient poor). The Eastern Brazil ecoregion is one of two coastal marine ecoregions (along with the Northeastern Brazil marine ecoregion) in the Tropical Southwest Atlantic marine province. It is thus part of the Tropical Atlantic realm. \n\n## Physical setting\n\n The ecoregion reaches out into the Atlantic Ocean for 200\u2013250 miles from the coast. The ecoregion is bounded on the north at the Bay of All Saints, and stretches for 1,000 coastal miles to the south at Cabo Frio, where the ecoregion transitions to the Southeastern Brazil marine ecoregion. The bordering coast is generally low and flat, and characterized by Bahia coastal forests ecoregion, and mangrove forests of the Bahia mangroves ecoregion. The major rivers feeding the Eastern Brazil marine region include the Jequitinhonha, Doce and Para\u00edba do Sul rivers. The continental shelf along this coast of Brazil extends about 30 miles out to sea in the north and south, but 130 miles in the middle. The deepest point in the ecoregion overall is , and the average is . A prominent underwater feature in the middle of the ecoregion is the Albrohos Shelf, a portion of the continental shelf extending 200\u00a0km offshore. Besides supporting extensive coral reef complexes, the Albrohos shelf includes the largest known continuous rhodolith bed in the world, with an estimated area of 20,900 km2. Rhodoliths are calcareous nodules created by Coralline algae, and support diverse benthic communities in a manner similar to shallow coral reefs. Another prominent underwater feature is the east\u2013west trending Vit\u00f3ria-Trindade Seamount Chain (VTC). The seamounts in the ecoregion are known to support high biodiversity in fish species, but are relatively under-explored. The offshore basins of the ecoregion, from north to south, are the Camamu-Almada Basin, the Jequitinhonha Basin, the Cumuruxatiba Basin, the Mucuri Basin, and the Espirito Santo Basin. Oil and gas exploration and production are underway in the northern two basins. \n\n## Currents and climate\n\n The Atlantic South Equatorial Current (SEC) flows directly into the ecoregion from the East, bringing warm water from the South Atlantic Ocean. As the SEC approaches the eastern point of Brazil at Cape S\u00e3o Roque, it splits, with the North Brazil Current (NBC) flowing along the coast to the north and west, and the Brazil Current flowing south along the eastern coast. The Brazil Current is a western boundary current, flowing at a rate averaging 4 Sverdrups (Sv), at a mean speed of . Surface temperatures range from . \n\n## Animals / Fish\n\n Biodiversity of the near-shore areas varies with the influence of the coasts - mangroves, sandbanks, and beaches - and also by the nature of the bottoms, which are reefs, gravel and mud. There are a variety of fish, cetaceans, turtles, shrimps and lobsters. A recent study found 25 species of shark and 9 species of rays. Over 90% of commercial fishing is on the nearshore coast, typically by artisinal (subsistence and traditional) methods. Traditional methods of hook and line fishing, and with gillnets, are employed on small boats seeking drum fish (family \"Sciaenidae\"). Small shrimp trawlers and lobster boats also operate in the coastal waters, with some evidence that use of nets by lobster fishers is causing harm to the bottom for other species. In the south, along Rio de Janeiro state, the artisinal beach fishery uses large canoes and seine nets to catch migrating schools of bluefish, mullets and bonitos. Offshore, the industrial fisheries of the region are mostly employ hook-and-line methods rather than trawlers due to the narrow coastal shelf, rocky bottom, and deep canyons. The commercial fishery is centered on rockfish, sharks and tuna. \n\n## Conservation status\n\n Many of the terrestrial protected areas on the coast have marine components, such that about 8% of the ecoregion is protected, including:  As of 2013, only 2% of the Albrohos Shelf, with its Mesophotic coral reefs, was in a \"no-take\" protected area.", "Cl\u00e9venot": "Cl\u00e9venot is a surname.

He attended Auburn University, where he earned his degree in 1960; he was the first person in his family to attend college. Crutchfield moved to Atlanta, where he worked for the stationery manufacturer Montag, which was later bought by Mead.  In 1971, Crutchfield participated in the development of the ABC television special \"Good Vibrations from Central Park\", which featured the Beach Boys and Carly Simon, but also included pitches for Mead's product line, in a bid to get students to start thinking about school and school supplies. He also earned in-house awards for his product developments Crutchfield had begun to evolve his loose-leaf ring binder \"Trapper Keeper\" in the 1970s, but took his time bringing it to market.

His son and principal heir George Braxton, Jr. also served in the House of Burgesses, but his most notable descendant (who was 12 when this grandfather died) was Carter Braxton, who became a Founding Father of the United States. \n\n## Career\n\n Braxton owned 2825 acres in King and Queen County by 1704. His main plantation was Newington, on the bluffs above the Mattaponi River about 18 miles upstream from West Point, the county seat at the stream's confluence with the York River. He became one of the largest landowners in the Northern Neck of Virginia and probably one of the 100 largest in the colony. He and his namesake son also owned a ship, \"Braxton\", and leased others to carry on a triangular trade with the West Indies and Britain. About once a year, the Braxtonx served as commission agents for cargoes of enslaved Blacks. Braxton accepted the governor's appointment as colonel of the King and Queen county militia, as well as coroner and one of the justices of the peace who collectively administered the county. He probably also served on the vestry of St. Stephen's parish (which also were responsible for care of the poor and disabled), although its records did not survive. King and Queen county voters first elected Braxton as one of their two representatives in the House of Burgesses in 1718, and he served (with a gap) for about three decades. Beginning in 1728, Braxton served alongside John Robinson, who would become the family's major benefactor, although a scandal erupted after his death. Braxton also served on the select committee that assisted the governor in building the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg. \n\n## Personal life\n\n By 1702, Braxton had marreid Elizabeth Pallin, daughter of planter Thomas Paullin. Both husband and wife signed the loyalty assurance of 1702 to the dying king. They had a son, George Braxton Jr. (who was attending the College of William and Mary by 1720) and daughters Hannah and Elizabeth who reached adulthood. Hannah married Philemon Bird and after his death Thomas Price of nearby Middlesex County. Elizabeth married Col. Humphrey Brooke of King William County, whose surveyor brother Robert Brooke accompanied the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe on their western excursion to the Blue Ridge Mountains. Their son George Brooke would become Treasurer of Virginia. \n\n## Death and legacy\n\n Braxton died on July 1, 1748 and was probably buried at his Newington plantation. A memorial plaque at Mattaponi Church (which in his day was the Lower Church of St. Stephen's parish and rebuilt in 1730-1734) honors his service. Although his son George Braxton Jr. was his principal heir, when his grandson George Braxton III died in 1761, most of the family properties (by then subject to significant debts) were inherited by Carter Braxton.", "Myxine debueni": "Myxine debueni, the Magellan hagfish, is a species of jawless fish in the family Myxinidae.

It covers Gwembe and Munyumbwe in Gwembe District of Southern Province.", "Iguanodectes rachovii": "Iguanodectes rachovii is a species of freshwater fish that inhabits the rivers of the Amazon basin. It largely consumes insects, though it will eat plants if given the opportunity, and has a peaceful disposition, able to live alongside various other species. It is often found in groups of 3 to 30 specimens, lingering at the edges of streams near the surface of the water. Given its appealing coloration, \"I. rachovii\" has a minor presence in aquarium settings, but is not often taken from the wild for export. Arthur Rachow, an aquarist from Germany, brought specimens of \"I. rachovii\" to the attention of British ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan, thereby assisting in the discovery and description of a new species. Subsequently, the fish was named in his honor. \n\n## Description\n\n \"Iguanodectes rachovii\" is a small fish, reaching a maximum of 6.2 cm (2.4 in) standard length (SL). It has an elongate body shape, and is generally quite slender, as is the case in all \"Iguanodectes\"; before it was properly understood as its own species, it was temporarily referred to as the \"slender \"Tetragonopterus\"\". There is no known sexual dimorphism. The body is generally silvery, with an olive-yellow back, and a prominent lateral stripe. This stripe has three colors - red, silver, and black, from top-to-bottom. The red coloration originates in the upper half of the eye, and can be traced the length of the body, ending before the caudal fin. The white stripe begins behind the pectoral fin. The black stripe encompasses the bottom of the eyes, and meets a patch of dark pigmentation in the middle of the caudal fin. The fins are hyaline (clear). The anal fin starts at the middle of the dorsal fin, and has a high number of fin rays, from 30 to 34. This is a differentiating factor from \"I. rachovii\" to \"Hemigrammus gracilis\", for which it was originally mistaken (known as \"Tetragonopterus gracilis\" at the time); \"H. gracilis\" only has 20-24 anal-fin rays. \n\n## Taxonomy\n\n \"Iguanodectes rachovii\" has retained its original name, given by British ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan in 1912. Though originally mistaken for an unknown member of genus \"Tetragonopterus\", this was swiftly corrected, and \"I. rachovii\" has been considered a member of \"Iguanodectes\" since description. \n\n## Etymology\n\n The specific name \"rachovii\" honors German aquarist Arthur Rachow, who brought the type specimen (collected previously, under the assumption that it was a different species) to the attention of the British Museum of Natural History. The generic name \"iguanodectes\" was not given a clear meaning in the nominal text, but can likely trace its roots to \"iguana\", the lizard, and \"dectes\", meaning \"bite\" or \"tooth\". \n\n## Distribution and habitat\n\n \"Iguanodectes rachovii\" has a broad range that encompasses multiple tributaries of various rivers, including the Guam\u00e1, Amazon main, Marapanim, and Maracan\u00e3 rivers. It tends to inhabit the margins of its native streams, which are usually clearwater, and does not demonstrate a notable preference for the presence of currents, found in areas of variable flow. \n\n## Diet and ecology\n\n \"Iguanodectes rachovii\" is primarily an insectivore with omnivorous traits. Smaller individuals demonstrate a preference for aquatic insects and larvae, while larger individuals tend to target terrestrial insects. Larger specimens will also take supplementary plant material, including algae and riparian vegetation, depending on if the surrounding conditions are favorable for plants that are acceptable for consumption. \"Iguanodectes rachovii\" is a peaceful fish that lives in groups of up to 30 individuals. It is also regularly found in sympatry with unrelated, or distantly related, species. Early specimens were caught alongside the red-spotted tetra, \"Copeina guttata\" (then referred to as \"Pyrrhulina guttata\"), and Ulrey's tetra, \"Hemigrammus ulreyi\" (then referred to as \"Tetragonopterus ulreyi\"). Modern studies include the Colletti tetra, \"Moenkhausia collettii\", in sympatric species. \n\n## Presence and behavior in aquaria\n\n In the modern era, \"I. rachovii\" is known to be allowed for export for the ornamental fish trade, but details are sparse. Though \"I. rachovii\" was lauded by aquarists upon publication for its appealing coloration, collectors were cautioned that it has been observed eating plants commonly found in aquarium settings, like \"Heteranthera\" and \"Cabomba\". It seems to have trouble reproducing in captivity. \n\n## Conservation status\n\n \"Iguanodectes rachovii\" has a Red List evaluation of Least Concern, abundant in its wide native range and with few immediate threats to its population. It has been collected alongside other fish species that often ingest plastic particles as a consequence of pollution, but has not been examined for similar consumption.", "Love on a Leash": "Love on a Leash is a 2011 romantic comedy film.

He was the commander of the 7th Brigade of the 3rd Division during the war but was mortally wounded during the Battle of Ytoror\u00f3. \n\n## Military career\n\n Fernando was born as the son of Manuel Machado de Sousa and Josefa Bernardina Borges and would later marry Ang\u00e9lica Rosa Magalh\u00e3es Fontoura. During his childhood, he lived along the coast at Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de Itapocoroi and during his college years, he would study at a Jesuit school. He then joined the Imperial Brazilian Army on November 9, 1838, as a 1st cadet in the Provisional Corps of Desterro. He gained first promotion to Second Sergeant on February 1, 1839. He participated in the Ragamuffin War in Laguna and Rio Grande do Sul. During the War, he was stationed for the defense of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte against the forces of Bento Gon\u00e7alves da Silva. For his service, he was promoted to Lieutenant and stationed at the Batalh\u00e3o da Serra. He then briefly went north to suppress the Liberal rebellions of 1842 within the provinces of Minas Gerais and S\u00e3o Paulo. Machado de Sousa then returned south to participate in the Battle of Ponche Verde and the Battle of Porongos and served within the garrison of Alegrete under Colonel Arruda. He was then promoted to Captain on December 2, 1847, but was then transferred to Rio de Janeiro but from there, he was transferred to Minas Gerais where he stayed until November 1849. Before the Paraguayan War broke out, he was stationed in Paran\u00e1, Bahia, Pernambuco. Alagoas and Rio Grande do Sul as a subbortinate of Lu\u00eds Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias. By the time the Paraguayan War broke out, he was commanding a battalion with a malarial fever so he had to undergo treatment. When his health returned to an active state, he was given command of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 2nd Army Corps and participated in the Battle of Curuz\u00fa. He would then fight at the battles of Paso de Patria, Tuyut\u00ed where he would get wounded, Potreiro Pires, Linha Sauce, Curupayty and the Passage of Humait\u00e1. His final engagement would be at the Battle of Ytoror\u00f3 where he was mortally wounded while attempting to capture the bridge over the Arroyo Ytoror\u00f3 on December 6, 1868. \n\n## Legacy\n\n The street where he was born today bears his name as well as a square in Florian\u00f3polis which was inaugurated in 1917. In Porto Alegre he was also honored, in 1870, with the name of a street, formerly called Rua do Arvoredo. The 63rd Infantry Battalion of the Army, headquartered in Florian\u00f3polis, is named after him.

The Treasury Department\u2019s Public Works of Art Project, Section of Painting and Sculpture, and Treasury Relief Art Project, as well as the Civil Works Administration, the Public Works Administration, and the Civilian Conservation Corps were also charged with creating New Deal art. Documentary photographs for the FSA as well as the Office of War Information and the Resettlement Administration are also considered New Deal art. The Historic Sites Act of 1935 instigated a similar documentary record, including photographs and architectural plans, for the National Park Service properties.  Collectively, the artists of the New Deal produced a vast archive: Murals, including 1,100 post office murals (list), free-standing and bas relief sculpture, an estimated 30,000 posters, more than 700 books and pamphlets and radio scripts, and architectural details for scores of public buildings, in a style now called WPA Moderne. The New Deal arts programs emphasized regionalism, social realism, class conflict, proletarian interpretations and audience participation. The unstoppable collective powers of common man, contrasted to the failure of individualism, was a favorite theme.  Both the Whitney Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art created gallery shows in 1936 showcasing works by Treasury and WPA artists, respectively, that had been commissioned through the federal programs. \"The New York Times\" reported that the Whitney show \u201cabounds in vitality\u201d and was especially complementary about the sculpture, including William Zorach\u2019s \"Benjamin Franklin\" and Heinz Warneke\u2019s \"Bears\".", "Rhadinella serperaster": "Rhadinella serperaster is a species of snake in the family Colubridae.

The title was first mentioned in 2013 when Jes\u00fas R\u00e1bago, the director of a Mexican national pageant, Rostro de M\u00e9xico, appointed his 2012 contest winner, Laura Alvarez, to represent the country in the inaugural edition of the parent international contest, , in Thailand. The license was transferred to Miss Mexico Organization in 2017, and then to Flavio Falsiroli in 2022. Mexico has always sent its representatives to join the Miss Grand International pageant; the highest achievement is the first runner-up position, won in 2019 by . In addition, the country also won the Best Evening Gown award in\u00a02022. The current Miss Grand Mexico is Laysha Salazar from Sonora, which placed top 20 at Miss Grand International 2022.  \n\n## History\n\n Since the establishment of Miss Grand International in 2013, Mexico has always sent its representatives to compete at such every year. In the first four years, the country representatives were either handpicked or determined through a national pageant organized by Jes\u00fas R\u00e1bago, Rostro de M\u00e9xico. In 2017, Hugo Castellanos took over the franchise and the representatives were instead elected through another national pageant, Miss Mexico, until Castellanos lost the franchise to Flavio Falsiroli in 2022. Under the direction of Flavio Falsiroli, his first affiliated titleholder, Jessica Farjat, was appointed. The following representatives were expected to be elected through a national contest directed by Orlando Ruiz, Concurso Nacional de Belleza de M\u00e9xico (CNB M\u00e9xico). However, some internal conflicts caused Orlando Ruiz to vacate the team and Farjat also resigned from the title. Falsiroli then held an ad hoc audition to select a new representative; more than 20 applications were received, and a 19-year-old girl from Hermosillo, Laysha Salazar, was elected the winner.

This concept encapsulates various more specific concepts, such as that of a hyperfinite equivalence relation, but is of interest in and of itself. \n\n## Motivation\n\n A main area of study in invariant descriptive set theory is the relative complexity of equivalence relations. An equivalence relation formula_1 on a set formula_2 is considered more complex than an equivalence relation formula_3 on a set formula_4 if one can \"compute formula_3 using formula_1\" - formally, if there is a function formula_7 which is well behaved in some sense (for example, one often requires that formula_8 is Borel measurable) such that formula_9. Such a function If this holds in both directions, that one can both \"compute formula_3 using formula_1\" and \"compute formula_1 using formula_3\", then formula_1 and formula_3 have a similar level of complexity. When one talks about Borel equivalence relations and requires formula_8 to be Borel measurable, this is often denoted by formula_17. Countable Borel equivalence relations, and relations of similar complexity in the sense described above, appear in various places in mathematics (see examples below, and see for more). In particular, the Feldman-Moore theorem described below proved useful in the study of certain Von Neumann algebras (see ).  \n\n## Definition\n\n Let formula_2 and formula_4 be standard Borel spaces. A \"countable Borel relation\" between formula_2 and formula_4 is a subset formula_22 of the cartesian product formula_23 which is a Borel set (as a subset in the Product topology) and satisfies that for any formula_24, the set formula_25 is countable. Note that this definition is not symmetric in formula_2 and formula_4, and thus it is possible that a relation formula_22 is a countable Borel relation between formula_2 and formula_4 but the converse relation is not a countable Borel relation between formula_4 and formula_2. \n\n## The Luzin-Novikov Theorem\n\n This theorem, named after Nikolai Luzin and his doctoral student Pyotr Novikov, is an important result used is many proofs about countable Borel relations. Theorem. Suppose formula_2 and formula_4 are standard Borel spaces and formula_22 is a countable Borel relation between formula_2 and formula_4. Then the set formula_58 is a Borel subset of formula_4. Furthermore, there is a Borel function formula_60 (known as a Borel uniformization) such that the graph of formula_8 is a subset of formula_22. Finally, there exist Borel subsets formula_63 of formula_2 and Borel functions formula_65 such that formula_22 is the union of the graphs of the formula_67, that is formula_68. This has a couple of easy consequences: Below are two more results which can be proven using the Luzin-Novikov Novikov theorem, concerning countable Borel equivalence relations: \n\n## Feldman-Moore Theorem\n\n The Feldman-Moore theorem, named after Jacob Feldman and Calvin C. Moore, states: Theorem. Suppose formula_1 is a Borel equivalence relation on a standard Borel space formula_2 which has countable equivalence classes. Then there exists a countable group formula_86 and action of formula_86 on formula_2 such that for every formula_89 the function formula_90 is Borel measurable, and for any formula_24, the equivalence class of formula_92 with respect to formula_1 is exactly the orbit of formula_92 under the action. That is to say, countable Borel equivalence relations are exactly those generated by Borel actions by countable groups. \n\n## Marker Lemma\n\n This lemma is due to Theodore Slaman and John R. Steel, and can be proven using the Feldman-Moore theorem: Lemma. Suppose formula_1 is a Borel equivalence relation on a standard Borel space formula_2 which has countable equivalence classes. Let formula_97. Then there is a decreasing sequence formula_98 such that formula_99 for all formula_100 and formula_101. Less formally, the lemma says that the infinite equivalence classes can be approximated by \"arbitrarily small\" set (for instance, if we have a Borel probability measure formula_102 on formula_2 the lemma implies that formula_104 by the continuity of the measure).", "Gnosis (Russian Circles album)": "Gnosis is the eighth studio album by American post-metal band Russian Circles.

It has millions of users who support its development through subscriptions. Reviewers have commented on the deep emotional intimacy which users have with Replika. Many users have had romantic relationships with Replika, often including erotic talk. In March 2023, Replika developers disabled its romantic and erotic functions. \n\n## History\n\n Eugenia Kuyda established Replika while at a tech company called Luka. Luka's primary product was a chatbot that made restaurant recommendations. After a friend of hers died in 2015, she converted that person's text messages into a chatbot. That chatbot helped her remember the conversations that they had together, and eventually became Replika. Replika became available to the public in November 2017. By January 2018 it had 2 million users. \n\n## Social features\n\n Users react to Replika in many ways. To some users it is a casual friendship, to others, it is like a therapist for talking about difficult topics, to some people with communication challenges it is conversation practice, and for others, it is a life coach who helps them keep the focus on tasks. Replika routinely directs the conversation to emotional discussion and builds intimacy. During the COVID pandemic, while many people were quarantined, many new users downloaded Replika and developed relationships with the app. A reviewer for \"Good Housekeeping\" said that some parts of her relationship with Replika made sense, but sometimes Replika failed to be as convincing as a human. \n\n## Sexual features\n\n In 2022 user subscriptions to Replika brought in millions of dollars every month. 60% of users had a romantic element in their chats with Replika. A social scientist and expert on sentiment who reviewed the app said that it was designed for emotional intimacy. A reviewer for Wired described herself as a mother with a toddler who was in a heterosexual and monogamous marriage. She reported being curious about Replika, then quickly coming to enjoy engaging in a sexual discussion with it. In 2023 the Replika developers disabled the app's erotic talk features. Kuyda, the Replika director, said that Replika was never intended for erotic discussion. Replika users disagreed, and complained that Replika used sexy advertising to draw users to the service. Also they pointed to years of user conversations in online forums discussing the use of Replika for erotic play. \n\n## Technical reviews\n\n There is an established field of research called attachment theory. One team of researchers found that Replika's design conformed to practices in that field which increase emotional attachment. Replika gives praise to users in such a way as to encourage more interaction. A review from a scholar of psychology reported that Replika's behavior was better to examine in the field of psychology, rather than as computer science or an abstract technical approach. Another reviewer said that relationships with Replika are likely to have effects on the spirituality of its users.", "Whose Line Is It Anyway?

After the war he became a founding member and secretary of the Radical Party until a scandal over his participation in anti-Semitist conferences during the Fascist period forced him to resign. \n\n## Biography\n\n During the First World War he was called up in 1917, fighting on the Karst Plateau and being later commissioned as a second lieutenant after attending an officer's course at the Military Academy of Turin; after the war he took part in Gabriele D'Annunzio's occupation of Fiume. In 1922 he entered the Judiciary of Italy and in 1930 the Council of State, of which he became a councilor in 1930. In 1932 he joined the National Fascist Party. After the fall of the Fascist regime, he was appointed Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Badoglio I Cabinet; in this role he proposed the appointment of Bruno Buozzi, Guido De Ruggiero, Giuseppe Di Vittorio, Achille Grandi, Oreste Lizzadri, Gioacchino Quarello, Giovanni Roveda and Ezio Vanoni as extraordinary commissioners of the trade union confederations. In November 1943 he resigned from his post as minister to enlist as an artillery captain in the Italian Co-belligerent Army until September 1944, when he was recalled and appointed extraordinary commissioner of the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale. In 1946 he was retired by the State Council. In 1953, Piccardi joined Popular Unity, a liberal socialist movement created to thwart the attempt made by the Christian Democrats, with the approval of the so-called \"fraud law\" (an electoral law that assigned 65 % of parliament seats to the party that gained at least 50 % of all valid votes), to \"fraudulently\" secure an absolute majority in the two branches of Parliament. Popular Unity ran in the political elections of 7 June 1953, obtaining a modest result and no seats, but sufficient to prevent the parties of the government coalition from reaching the quorum required for the majority prize. On 28 November 1954 Piccardi was elected to the executive committee of the movement, together with Tristano Codignola, Ferruccio Parri, Paolo Battino Vittorelli and Oliviero Zuccarini. However, in the Sicilian regional elections of 1955, \"Unit\u00e0 Popolare\" invited to vote the Italian Socialist Party; this caused a rift between Piccardi and his liberal democratic current and the rest of the party. During a meeting of the Central Committee (Rome, 18 December 1955), Piccardi and his group explained the reasons why they would detach from the movement. During 1955 Piccardi had participated in some meetings organized by the \"Friends \"Il Mondo\"\", and formed an executive committee in charge of creating a new liberal democratic party, which was established on 5 February 1956 with the name of Radical Party. Parri and Arrigo Olivetti (a liberal among the founders of Il Mondo, brother-in-law of the better known Adriano Olivetti) later passed from Popular Unity to the Radical Party as well. On 28 February 1959 Piccardi was elected to the post of secretary of the Radical Party, together with Franco Libonati, Arrigo Olivetti and Eugenio Scalfari. On 6 November 1960 he was to the city council of Rome. In 1961 historian Renzo De Felice, in a new book on the history of Italian Jews under Fascism, revealed that Piccardi, as a member of the Council of State, had participated in 1938 and 1939 in two Italian-German legal conferences on the theme \"Race and law\", which had contributed to the theoretical elaboration of the Italian racial laws. In December 1961 Mario Pannunzio and other members of the \"Friends of \"Il Mondo\"\" condemned Piccardi, asking for his resignation from the Radical Party, while Ernesto Rossi and Ferruccio Parri supported him. The party secretariat and leadership resigned; internal strife went on for a few months, and the Radical Party essentially disintegrated, with most of its member going over to the Italian Socialist Party. In October 1962 Piccardi, together with other radical exponents, asked for the dissolution of the party and its merger into the Italian Socialist Party, but internal conflicts pushed him to resign.", "Stubborn Love (album)": "Stubborn Love is the first album by Christian singer/songwriter Kathy Troccoli, released in 1982 on Reunion Records. \"Stubborn Love\" was reportedly the best-selling debut album by a contemporary Christian music female artist.

A brief summary of the game was included in the March 15, 1895 edition of the French journal \"L'Ingenieur Civil\" which explains that \"the game consists of a table with a rim, in which are cavities each defended by a player who must prevent a ball thrown on the table from falling into this cavity.\" In 1895, the Billard Nicolas table was manufactured by Jean-Anatole Jost, then located at 120 rue Oberkampf in Paris. In his history of \u00c9pinay-sur-Seine, Andr\u00e9 Clipet mentions that Nicolas Redler did not earn much from this invention. \n\n## Material\n\n The game board is made of wood, in the form of a circular track, bordered by a band provided with four supports, each supporting a bellows that can pivot freely, which is used to blow balls on the table. Today, other game boards may have three and six holes, for as many players. In Anglo-Saxon countries, the game may be known as puff billiards or pneumatic billiards. \n\n## Game play\n\n The game is played by four players, who try to direct \u2013 by projecting jets of air \u2013 a small cork ball towards one of the opposing holes, and to prevent it from falling into theirs. Each ball lodged costs one point to the player who received it. He then tosses the ball back on the game board and the game continues.

In that year, Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez de Traba and his followers robbed some merchants who had come to Padr\u00f3n from England and Lotharingia to sell their wares in the market of Santiago de Compostela. According to the \"Historia Compostellana\", the archbishop sent Pelayo at the head of a group of soldiers to recover the loot. The robbers were confronted in the mountains, defeated in combat and the loot recovered and restored to the merchants.

Pelayo witnessed his first royal charter in May 1133. He never regularly attended the royal court and, until 1155, he almost never attended without his father. After 1155, he generally appeared only on major occasions when the itinerant court was in the north of the kingdom. When his father was granted tenancies in the south of the kingdom in the 1140s, Pelayo was given his Galician tenancies. By 1149, he was tenant of region around Tui and by 1152 also of Toro\u00f1o. He mostly resided in these tenancies, which were on the border with Portugal. In 1140, Pelayo referred a dispute brought before him as lord by the nuns of San Pedro de Ramiranes and the knight \u00c1lvaro Rubeo to the royal court at Salamanca.

The \"Poema de Almer\u00eda\" does not name him, but mentions the participation of Fernando Y\u00e1\u00f1ez and his many sons. Pelayo did not inherit Montoro from his father in 1154. It was given instead to Nu\u00f1o P\u00e9rez de Lara. On 26 September 1158, King Ferdinand II granted him lands in compensation for damage done to his lands in Galicia by Portuguese forces.

To remove the hairpin at the Planques, a ramp was drawn along the edge which was built, by volunteers, stood on either side as well as a passage under the track which leaded the riders to their pits. The starting line was permanently fixed there. At the end of the grandstand (south of the starting line) was built the timing tower, the only vestige still in place from that time.

It is located south of the Qingniwaqiao CBD, at the northern foot of Green Mountain (\u7eff\u5c71), and only 500 meters from Dalian Railway Station. With an area of 1.02 million square meters, it is the largest park in the city center and the earliest large-scale urban park. The annual tourist volume reaches more than 3 million people. It is such a popular place among the Dalianites that matchmakers post, on weekends, the paper slips on the branches of the trees in the eastern corner of the park, showing potential brides and bridegrooms. \n\n## History\n\n The original site of the park was in Wesy Qingniwa Village. The park was built in 1898 by Imperial Russia, which occupied L\u00fcda. It was located in the west of Dalian (then named Dalini City) at that time, so it was named West Park. Japan defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, and after occupying L\u00fcda, the park was expanded, and has a sumo wrestling field, a golf course, horse riding clubs, swimming pools, etc. At that time, there was a tiger in the park, so it was renamed Tiger Park. In 1925, a tower for soldiers who died in battle was built in the south of the park, and the ashes of the Japanese war dead were moved from Asahi Square (also known as Laozhongbei Square, now Sanba Square). With the expansion of the urban area, the park was gradually moved to its current site in the city center, so it was renamed Central Park (\u4e2d\u592e\u516c\u5712) in 1926. After Japan was defeated in World War II and withdrew from China, on November 1, 1947, the park was renamed Lenin Park in accordance with the decision of the CPC Central Committee. On the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the local government mobilized the mass to do voluntary labor to renovate the park, and erected a monument beside the lotus pond in the park, with the words \"Labor Creates the World\" (\u52b3\u52a8\u521b\u9020\u4e16\u754c) written on the monument, so the park was changed to the current name of Laodong Park (Laodong means \"labor\") on March 3, 1949. The Zhongling Tower in the park was renamed the Wuyi Tower, meaning the \"May Day Tower\". Later, the Wuyi Tower was demolished, some saying in 1975 and others in the 1960s. \n\n## Recent Status\n\n In the eastern part of the park is the lotus pond. The bridge there is the historical Qingniwa Bridge. Red-crowned cranes, peacocks, sika deer and other animals are kept in the cages in the western part of the park. The terrain in the south is relatively high, and there is a viewing platform, overlooking Dalian's CBD. There is also a new playground, which has the first double-track dry land sled in China, and a rafting facility for amusement, the largest investment project pf the park. \n\n## Blessing bell\n\n The blessing bell (\u7948\u798f\u949f) was originally cast in Korea in 1347 AD, during Emperor Emperor's reign of the Yuan Dynasty. In 1905, Abe Eizen (\u963f\u90e8\u8363\u5168), the master of the Japanese Buddhism Togan Sect, came to Dalian to preach and to prepare for the construction of Higashi Honganji Temple branch. After learning about the bell in Incheon, Korea, he reported it to the Japanese authorities in the following year, so they moved it to Higashi Honganji Temple branch in Dalian. In 1958, it was moved to Laodong Park. Inscribed on the bell is the Sanskrit text from the \"Aroni Mantra\" scripture, hence the name. \n\n## Centennial warehouse\n\n Located in the north of the park, it was sealed up on September 19, 1999, on the centennial day of Dalian\u2019s founding. The warehouse stores the 100 most meaningful objects in the past century since Dalian\u2019s founding. In addition, Jiang Zemin, then General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President of the State, wrote the title and the letter written him to the then mayor Bo Xilai in 2099 is inscribed. There is a stone tablet oi the warehouse, and a forest of pink cherry trees and deep blue peaches are planted. It was to be unsealed on the 200th anniversary of the founding of Dalian. For some reason, the centennial warehouse was gradually removed from 2016 to 2017. The original site is now covered by colored bricks, and the whereabouts of the items in the warehouse are unknown. \n\n## Big soccer ball\n\n Located in the south of the park is a big soccer ball, colored in red and white.

The Edinburgh Football Association was founded on 11 September 1875 at the Buchanan Hotel with four members: The original intention was to form \"the Eastern branch of the Scottish Football Association\", but as the Scottish FA refused permission to use the title, the Edinburgh Football Association was adopted as a name instead. The Hibernian F.C. was refused permission to enter the EFA on the basis that \"they played rough and affiliated clubs were asked not to play them\". One of the key influences on the 3rd E.R.V. was John Hope, who had founded the Foot-Ball Club of Edinburgh in 1824, and who had raised a regiment which had been absorbed into the 3rd in 1867. Hope was staunchly Protestant, and led the opposition to having an \"Irish\" club in the association. \n\n## Semi-finals\n\n The EFA set up a competition for its members and all four entered. The first match \"for the Eastern branch trophy\" was played on 20 November 1875, between the Thistle and the Heart of Midlothian, and took place on the eastern part of the Meadows, as almost all of the early matches in Edinburgh did. Thistle won 1\u20130. The other match, a de facto semi-final, on 11 December saw the 3rd E.R.V. beat Hanover 2\u20130, also on the Meadows. \n\n## Final\n\n The final was played on the Meadows on 11 March 1876, the same day as the 1876 Scottish Cup final. The Edinburgh final proved to be a one-sided affair, with the 3rd E.R.V. winning 6\u20130. The play was \"very fast\" and the forward play of the Volunteers \"deserving of much praise\". \n\n## Aftermath\n\n The competition was barely noticed in the Edinburgh papers, only one report of the final mentioning the surnames of the players, and none mentioning the scorers in any of the ties. The final was not even mentioned in the Glasgow media, the North British Daily Mail listing two rugby fixtures in Edinburgh for 11 March, but not the Edinburgh Cup final. However the association game became the dominant code in Edinburgh, with much more comprehensive reporting, within a couple of years. The Hibernian was allowed into the Edinburgh FA for 1876\u201377, following pressure from players of other clubs. That season, Thistle was awarded the trophy by default, as opponents the 3rd E.R.V. did not show up. By 1879\u201380, the tournament had grown to 22 clubs; when the Hibs won the trophy for the third consecutive year in 1880\u201381, the club was awarded the trophy in perpetuity, and the competition renamed the Edinburgh Shield.

Constructed in 1874 to provide mechanical power, the dam now hosts the only hydroelectric plant in the state of Kansas. The dam, which is 655 feet long and approximately 17.08 feet tall, supplies water to two hydroelectric powerhouses, which have a combined installed capacity of seven megawatts. It impounds a 423-acre reservoir, which is used for recreation and as a water source for one of Lawrence's water treatment plants. \n\n## History\n\n For the first two decades after Lawrence's founding in 1854, the city's only sources of energy were wood and imported fuel. By the late 1860s, however, limited local timber resources had been depleted, and the city faced an energy crisis. Looking to emulate the success of eastern water-driven industrial cities like Lowell, Massachusetts, local leaders entertained plans to build a stone dam across the Kansas River. The city of Lawrence contracted with engineer Orlando Darling, who founded the Lawrence Land and Water Company (LL&amp;W Co.) to manage the project. Due to structural problems and flood damage, including a destructive ice jam flood in 1873, Darling was unable to fulfill the terms of his contract with the city and resigned his position before the dam could be completed. Although LL&amp;W Co. completed the structure without Darling, floods and slow development continued to plague the company, and it went into receivership in 1878. The property was then purchased by James H. Gower, who conferred it upon his son in law, Justin De Witt Bowersock. Apart from a small break in 1885, the dam withstood floods under Bowersock's leadership, and water power fueled substantial industrial growth in Lawrence in the late 19th century. After an ice jam severely damaged the original water mill in 1888, Bowersock improved the structure and installed four dynamos, which introduced electricity to Lawrence for the first time. After a severe flood in 1903 destroyed the original mill, Bowersock constructed a new powerhouse designed primarily to generate hydroelectricity, although some businesses in Lawrence still used mechanical waterpower until 1972. While electricity produced by the dam was initially directly distributed in Lawrence, the current operator of the dam, Bowersock Mills and Power Company (BMPC), sells power to the Kansas City Board of Public Utilities. Later in 20th century, changes in electrical infrastructure led to decreased demand for hydroelectric power from the dam, and the structure fell on hard times until a 1977 agreement between the BMPC and the city of Lawrence conferred responsibility for dam maintenance on the city. In 2011, BMPC broke ground on a new powerhouse on the north end of the dam, substantially increasing the dam's power output.", "Republican Party (Spain, 1913)": "The Republican Party (, PRep) was a Republican Spanish politician party created in 1913 as a re-foundation of the Republican movement, following the disbanding of the Republican Union Party and the splitting of the Radical Republican Party (PRR), the Republican Nationalist Federal Union (UFNR) and the Reformist Party (PRef) from the Republican\u2013Socialist Conjunction.", "2023 Intercontinental Cup (India)": "The 2023 Intercontinental Cup (known as the 2023 Hero Intercontinental Cup for sponsorship reasons) will be the third edition of the Intercontinental Cup, a 4-nations football tournament.

He was the older brother of the painter K\u00e4the Kollwitz. In the mid-1880s he studied in Berlin and in 1887 he defended his doctoral dissertation in Leipzig on \"Natural Wages\", in which he compared the theories of wages and exploitation of Johann Karl Rodbertus and Karl Marx. Schmidt dismissed Marx's theory as an unproven hypothesis in favor of Rodbertus' theory, which was based on the recognition of natural rights. However, after a closer examination of Marx's writings, Schmidt revised his sentence and became an adherent of Marxism. Schmidt dealt with the transformation problem that Friedrich Engels described in 1885 in the preface to the second volume of Das Kapital. Schmidt proposed his solution to Engels and, with the support of Engels and Karl Kautsky, in 1889 published the work \"Average profit based on Marx's law of value.\" He became close to Friedrich Engels and often spent evenings at his house. Schmidt and Engels maintained a lively correspondence. Engels' letter to Schmidt, on October 27, 1890, is considered an important document in the history of Marxism. In 1890, on the advice of Engels, Schmidt accepted a position as editor of the Swiss newspaper \"Z\u00fcricher Post\". Schmidt turned on the economic determinism of Engels and switched to neo-Kantian positions. He emphasized the ethical aspects of the labor movement such as sacrifice, consciousness and party loyalty. According to Schmidt, these qualities arise from the primary animal superegoistic instincts that are formed in every living being in the course of evolution to preserve the species and become more conscious and rational in humans in order to be realized in the working class. The philosophical works of Schmidt, in which he proposed to combine Marxism with the philosophy of Kant, served as an ideological source of revisionism espoused by Eduard Bernstein. Since Schmidt saw no possibility of an academic career in Switzerland for himself, he returned to Berlin in 1895, where he worked for the social democratic weekly newspaper \"Vorw\u00e4rts\". He was chairman of the Freie Volksb\u00fchne from 1897 to 1918. In 1919 Konrad Haenisch appointed him professor at the Berlin Polylitechnikum.

It was built in the Stick-Eastlake style (a combination of Stick style and Eastlake movement). The house was moved in 1889 to its current location at 1153 Oak Street.  In 1928, the house was sold and the following year it was converted into apartments. By 1930, the ballroom portion of the building was used as a dance school. In 1975 and 1976, the house was restored by a local preservation group, in hopes of improving the neighborhood. It is located near the Abner Phelps House, another historic building. \n\n## Mish family\n\n The house was built for Phenes and Sarah Mish and their 10 children. The Mish family moved to San Francisco in 1849.

The temple's full name is , and it belongs Daikaku-ji branch of the Shingon-shu of Japanese Buddhism. \n\n## History\n\n The temple was founded around 950 in the Heian period by the itinerant monk K\u016bya, although the early history of the temple's largely conjectural. The oldest existing structure is the Reception Hall, which was constructed in the Genroku era, around 1650, of then Edo Period. The temple is noted primarily for its role as a guest house for Korean envoys, and it became a place of interaction with Japanese scholars of Chinese medicine and Chinese calligraphy. In 1711 Lee Seon-young, an official in charge of the Korean delegation, praised the view from the Reception Hall as the best scenic beauty in Japan, and in 1748 Chief envoy Hong Gye-hee named the Reception Hall 'Taich\u014dr\u014d'. \n\n## Joseon missions to Japan\n\n Since ancient times, Tomo prospered as a port on the Seto Inland Sea, where ships shelter while for waiting for winds and tides. These included the official diplomatic envoys from Korea to Japan, who were sent twelve times during the Edo period. These missions consisted of several hundred people, led by three ambassadors. The delegation traveled 2,200 kilometers each way from Seoul to Edo, taking eight months to a year to make the round trip. The route was fixed: Busan to Tsushima, Iki, Ainoshima, Akama, via the Seto Inland Sea, Kaminoseki, Shimokamagari, Tomo, Ushimado, Murotsu, Hy\u014dgo, Osaka. The delegation's boats then anchored, and the delegation transferred to river barges and headed up the Yodo River. After passing through Kyoto, \u014ctsu, and Kusatsu the delegation left the Nakasend\u014d at Koshinohara in Yasu and passes through the Ch\u014dsenjin Kaid\u014d. After Hikone, it returned to the Nakasend\u014d again at Toriimoto, and headed for Edo via the T\u014dkaid\u014d via \u014cgaki and Nagoya. Of these sites relations to this journey, three locations were designated National Historic Sites in 1994: Fukuzen-ji in Fukuyama, Hiroshima, Honren-ji in Ushimado, and Seiken-ji in Okitsu. At the three temples mentioned above, artifacts such as plaques and Chinese poems left by delegation have been preserved. The scenery of Tomo was already appreciated by Koreans even before Taich\u014dr\u014d was built, and Lee Kyeong-seop, who was an official in charge in 1617, wrote, \"When you reach Jilpo, it is the most beautiful and strange.\" In addition, the \"Fuso Diary\" by the chief envoy, Cho Seo, in 1655, the \"Fuso Roku\" by Nan Long Yi, the \"Tojo Nikroku\" by the translator, Kim Seon-nam, and other diaries and records, give high praise for the temple's location and scenery. However, after 1711, both the temple and Taichoro fell into disrepair, though not uninhabited, and when the next embassy visited the site in 1748, another facility was designated as a lodging. The party was indignant at this situation, and after staying overnight on the ship in protest instead of the new lodgings, Hong Qixi, who was the chief envoy, went to Fukuzen-ji by force, comforting the monks and demanding its return as the officially-designated lodgings. He wrote an inscription renaming the Reception Hall as \"Taich\u014dr\u014d\", had it copied by his son Hong Jinghai, who was also a military officer, and gave it to the monks. The letters on the extant flat plaque at the temple is a copy of this. When the next embassy visited in 1763, the delegation described with deep emotion their pleasure that the temple had been restored as the official lodgings. The temple briefly played role in the Bakumatsu period when it served as a place of negotiation between Sakamoto Ryoma's \"Kaientai\" and Kish\u016b Domain of compensation for the accidental sinking of the \"Kaientai's\" steamship \"Iroha-maru\" en route to Tosa Domain with a cargo of western weaponry.

It is a type of checking. The purpose of the backcheck is to try to limit the opponents options as they head up the ice towards the backchecking team's end zone. The backcheck may be initialized by situations such as having lost the puck in the opponent's half of the ice, the opponents having played through the first line of pressure in their own end zone, or having lost a faceoff in the neutral zone.  An important aspect of backchecking is counting the opponent's players. This is so as to make sure that the opponents are not gaining any significant numerical advantages on the ice during transition. Failure to adequately count numbers in particular in the neutral zone by the backchecking team most likely leads to numerical advantages by the opponent when, and if, entering the backchecking team's end zone.  A proper backcheck leads to significantly less time and space for the opponents during transition, and as such may cause them to turn the puck over, effectively avoiding an end zone entry altogether - if not, then the defensive team will still be well organized following a zone entry by the opponent, and thus a proper backcheck also helps in limiting scoring chances in subsequent play on the ice.

It was developed by Fraunhofer Institute SIT (Secure Information Technology). The code contains one primary symbol and optionally multiple secondary symbols. The primary symbol contains four finder patterns located at the corners of the symbol. The code uses either 4 or 8 colours. The 4 basic colours (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) are the 4 primary colours of the subtractive CMYK colour model which is the most widely used system in the industry for colour printing on a white base such as paper. The other 4 colours (blue, red, green, and white) are secondary colours of the CMYK model and originate as an equal mixture of a pair of basic colours. The barcode is not subject to licensing and was submitted to ISO/IEC standardization as ISO/IEC 23634 expected to be approved at the beginning of 2021 and finalized in 2022. The software is open source and published under the LGPL v2.1 license. The specification is freely available. Because the colour adds a third dimension to the two-dimensional matrix, a JAB Code can contain more information in the same area compared to two-colour (black and white) codes \u2013 theoretically twice as much data for a 4 colour code and three times more for 8 colours assuming the same encoding algorithm. This can allow storage of an entire message in the barcode, rather than just storing partial data with a reference to a full message somewhere else (such as a link to a website), thus eliminating the need for additional always-available infrastructure beyond the printed barcode itself.

Aristonicus was very offended by this, and therefore he decided to take power by force. At first, Aristonicus seized power in the coastal city of Levki (between Smyrna and Phocaea), later he adopted the name of his father Eumenes III and began to seize power in cities that did not obey him. Further events are described by Strabo:Subsequently, Aristonicus managed to win a number of lightning victories over Rome and its allies, the most vivid of which is mentioned by many ancient historians: Strabo, Plutarch, but the most detailed victory over Publius Licinius Crassus was described by Eutropius:Having learned about the failure of Crassus, in 130 BC. the consul Mark Perperna went to correct the situation and did it very successfully: having gathered an army, he landed in Asia Minor and unexpectedly attacked Aristonicus, defeating his army. Aristonicus had no choice but to flee to the city of Stratonicea. The liberation of cities and territories previously captured by Aristonicus began. The Roman army dealt with the rebels particularly cruelly: they poisoned water and food, the Romans tortured and then killed the prisoners. Under this pressure, Aristonicus surrendered. He was sent to Rome, where he was strangled in prison. However, without Aristonikus, his small troops fought against the Roman army for one more year: in 129 BC. the Roman army under the leadership of the consul Manius Aquilius finally destroyed the remnants of the rebel units.

It was designed, built, and flown by Joseph A. Zinno, of North Providence, Rhode Island. Zinno had previously been a USAF Lieutenant Colonel, and undertook the challenge of making a human-powered aircraft as a post-retirement project. Design work began in January 1972 with construction, said to have involved 7,000 hours, commencing in March 1973. The aircraft was a mid-wing monoplane, with a pod and boom configuration. The fuselage's primary structure was made from light alloy tubing, whereas the wing's had a box-spar made from wood and plywood. The secondary structure was made using aluminum, wood, ply, foam and plastics. The entire aircraft was covered in a transparent plastic film. The wing had a complex planform, consisting of four separate sections, of varying tapers and chords. A high camber Wortmann airfoil, the FX72-150, was used inboard near the wing-root while, further outboard, the more efficient Wortmann FX63-137 section was selected. Zinno stated this was \"to compensate for the hellatious diving moment\".  The pilot sat in a recumbent position, and operated a reciprocating pedal drive system, to power a two bladed variable-pitch pusher propeller, located at the rear of the streamlined nacelle. A boom at the base of the nacelle extended to the empennage at the rear. Directional control was by a fin-mounted counter-balanced rudder. Pitch control was by an all-flying tail-plane fitted to the trailing edge of the tailfin. Lateral control was attained by wingtip ailerons. The undercarriage consisted of two bicycle wheels arranged in tandem, while two small wheels, on outriggers, were positioned underneath the wing.  On January 16, 1976, the FAA gave the aircraft an Airworthiness Certificate with the registration NIZB. Flight tests were conducted at the Quonset Point Air National Guard Station in Rhode Island, with Zinno acting as pilot. A series of taxiing trials began on April 15. On the morning of April 21, during its fourth run of the day, the \"Olympian\" flew for 5 seconds. The distance covered was variously reported to have been between 33 and 100 feet (10 and 30 meters). During landing, the aircraft suffered a ground loop, which damaged the undercarriage and other components. Further tests were conducted in September 1976, with the aircraft making towed flights. On its final flight, the right wing suffered a structural failure of the wing-spar, at its root, damaging the aircraft beyond repair.

After graduating from North High School in 1991, Strand joined the North Iowa Huskies to continue his junior career. His numbers with the club were solid but unremarkable. He was, however, able to earn a place on the varsity team at Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire. After a bad season during his freshman year, Strand was able to help the Blugolds post a winning season as a sophomore. His numbers remained consistent as an upperclassman, however, the team declined and ended with losing records in his final two years. After graduating with a degree in Kinesiology, Strand continued his playing career with the Madison Monsters, a UHL team. He provided modest depth scoring for two seasons before the Monsters moved to Knoxville. Strand stayed in the area and joined the replacement Madison Kodiaks for their inaugural season in 1999, however, he retired as a player after the year. When he was in 5th grade, Strand had written a school paper saying that when he grew up he wanted to wither be a fireman or coach. In 2002, he was able to fulfill one of those dreams by joining St. Norbert as an assistant. He helped the Green Knights take the next step in their ascent, finishing the regular season as the #1 team in the country while losing just 1 game. St. Norbert ended up losing in the National Semifinal to the eventual champion, however, they also lost Strand after the year when he accepted a similar position with the Green Bay Gamblers. In two years with the club, Strand was unable to help improve their performance as they missed the playoffs both years. He was, however, able to move on and accepted his first head coaching job, returning to his alma mater. Strand's second appearance with the Blugolds came as the program was experiencing its nadir and they won just 2 games in his first year behind the bench. While his second season also ended with a losing record, the team performed far better and nearly quintupled their win total. The swift turnaround garnered Strand his first coaching job in the pro ranks and he joined the Houston Aeros as an assistant. Two years later, Strand returned to the USHL as the head coach for the Sioux City Musketeers. Two years on, after mediocre results, Strand won on the move again and he worked as an assistant for the Abbotsford Heat. Two years later, Strand tried his hand at being a general manager, working in that position for the Musketeers. He lasted just 7 months before accepting the head coaching position for the expansion Madison Capitols. Predictably, the first year team posted a losing record but it would be the best season for the franchise until 2021\u201322. Strand left the Capitols after just one season to take his first job at the Division I level, serving as an assistant at Wisconsin. After the season, the head coach, Mike Eaves was not retained and his entire staff was let go. After spending a year working as a scout, Strand returned to the Sioux City for a third stint with the Musketeers. This time, however, he stuck around for a while. Strand served as the head coach for 5 seasons and slowly built the team into a power. In 2022, the Musketeers were third in the regular season and went on a tear through the playoffs, going 8\u20132 to win the franchise's first championship in 20 years. Coincidentally, Sioux City defeated the Madison Capitols in the finals. After winning his first title, Strand returned to the college ranks and served as an assistant at Ohio State. He helped the already-successful program return to the NCAA tournament and produce an excellent season, finishing in the top 10 and reaching the Quarterfinal round of the NCAA tournament.

He was posted to Venezuela, London, and the United States. In 1946 he assumed the position of vice-president of the Asiatic Petroleum Corporation in New York, which was the American subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell's Asiatic Petroleum Company. In 1948 he returned to London and held a series of senior postings with Shell.  While on vacation with his American wife at the Jokake Inn, Scottsdale, Arizona in November 1949, the Arizona Republic newspaper in an interview with Stephens contrasted his lifestyle with that of a top American oil company executive. The report said the American would have \"a big home, a couple or three cars, servants, a well-stocked wine cellar and a flock of dollars left after taxes\". Stephens meanwhile could not \"afford to run a car, lives in a London flat and his pocket money is equivalent to that carried by an American newspaper reporter\". The reason for the difference was put down to the high level of income taxes and sales taxes under the Labour Government in Britain. In 1951 Stephens became a director of Shell Transport and Trading, in 1957 the managing director, and in 1961 its chairman. He held the chair until 1967. In his parting address to the 1967 annual general meeting, Stephens warned that burgeoning investment in North Sea gas exploration risked being cut back unless an economic price for gas was agreed. He advocated for market forces to decide the price. This was at a time when the gas industry was nationalised in Britain and suppliers were paid unit prices agreed with the Gas Council. Sir Maurice Bridgman, chairman of BP agreed but Stephens' remarks were criticised by Labour's Minister of Power, Richard Marsh who retorted \"I do not think it helps or scares anyone to have leading figures in the oil industry to publicly threaten to discontinue exploration unless they get the price they want.\" Stephens remained managing director of Shell Transport and Trading until his retirement in 1971. In 1951 he also became a director of Royal Dutch Petroleum and from 1956 to 1961 was a principal director. From 1959 to 1961 he was the managing director of the Shell International Petroleum Company.

This first church was likely a wooden stave church that was located about to the northeast of the present church site. By the end of the 17th century, this stave church was in poor condition and was in constant need of repair, so the old church was torn down and a new church was built on the same site in 1727. The new church was a small, modest, wooden long church which was described as \"unsightly\" in 1785. In the mid-1800s, the old Heggland Church was closed and its people were divided between the two nearby churches: Veum Church and Moland Church. The current Veum Church (at that time) was too small and would need significant renovations and repairs to accommodate the newly enlarged parish. Also, a new main road through the village of \u00d8yane was built around the same time, so it was decided to build a new, larger church in the village, along the new main road. The parish underwent some difficult times around 1850 and there was some strong opposition to moving the church, so there were delays. Thus, the new church wasn't built until 1863. This new wooden long church was based on a standard architectural drawing by Christian Grosch and it was built by a builder named Svenkesen. The new church was consecrated on 14 August 1863. After the new building was completed, the old church was torn down. The new church originally had a rose window over the front door, but it eventually fell into disrepair and was removed.

During the Holy Year it remains open so that pilgrims, and others, may enter from the . Originally, the door was one of seven smaller doors that comprised the cathedral. It opens to the east at the apse onto the plaza. \n\n## Background\n\n Initially the door was known as the \"Porta de San Paio\" and was dedicated to St. Pelagius, for whom the monastery across the plaza is named. In his description of the cathedral, Aymeric Picaud in , Picaud describes the basilica as having three main porticoes and seven small ones: The east fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral that overlooks the has two gates: the Porta Real (royal gate) and the Porta Santa (holy gate). The construction of the Porta Real, baroque, was begun under the direction of Jos\u00e9 de Vega y Verdugo and by Jos\u00e9 de la Pe\u00f1a de Toro in 1666, and was completed by Domingo de Andrade in 1700, who built some of the columns that span two floors of windows, a balustrade with large pinnacles, and an aedicula with an equestrian statue of Saint James (now gone), well adorned with decorative fruit clusters and large-scale military trophies. The kings of Spain entered the cathedral through this door, hence its name, and the royal coat of arms on its lintel. The door is also known as the \"Door of Forgiveness\" (\"Galician: Porta do Perd\u00f3n\"). During a Jacobean Holy Year (years when Saint James' Day, July 25, falls on a Sunday), pilgrims who enter the basilica through the door earn a plenary indulgence granted by Pope Alexander III in his 1179 AD bull, \"Regis aeterni\". It is usually closed with a fence and opened only during the holy year. The door no longer is accessible from the outside. When the church was being expanded, a new wall closed the apse from view, further blocking the light and creating the false door that can be seen from the Quintana Plaza. The only remnant of the original exit is on the floor, where a symbolic star still indicates the place. The outside door's niches contain the image of James, with his disciples Athanasius and Theodore at his side. On the bottom and sides of the door are placed twenty-four figures of prophets and apostles (including St. James) coming from the old stone choir of Master Mateo. Inside this door through a small courtyard is the true Holy Door, which enters into the ambulatory of the apse of the church. The inside door opens into the ambulatory, between the \"Chapel of the Azucena or Saint Peter\" (\"Galician:Capilla de la Azucena o de San Pedro\") and the , where the construction of the cathedral began in 1075. There is a belief that the door was designated as the door for pilgrims because of its placement near the ambulatory. The ambulatory around the altar, and the descent to the tomb of the Apostle James may represent the end of the pilgrimage representing the pilgrimage. The exit from the tomb represents redemption and a new life, similar to that described in Plato's allegory of the cave. The door may not be in its original place, nor is it the original door.

When she was eight years old, the family emigrated to the United States for economic reasons. The family settled in Stamford, Connecticut.

This abnormality can be seen with a microscope and diagnosed by pathologists. It is caused by cigarette smoking. The term SRIF was coined by Dr. Anna-Luise Katzenstein (a pathologist) and colleagues in 2010 in a study of lung specimens surgically removed for lung cancer. Since then, other investigators have confirmed the same abnormality in the lungs of a subset of smokers. \n\n## Definition\n\n The defining feature of smoking-related interstitial fibrosis is a distinctive/unique type of fibrosis characterized by \"ropey\" collagen bundles within the walls of the air sacs (alveoli), almost always in association with other smoking-related abnormalities such as pigmented macrophages and emphysema. \n\n## Clinical symptoms\n\n Most cases of SRIF are discovered incidentally by pathologists examining lung tissue from lungs that have been removed surgically from patients with lung cancer. These patients generally have no symptoms attributable to fibrosis, although they may have symptoms attributable to emphysema (COPD), which is a common abnormality in smokers with lung cancer. A few cases of SRIF in which patients were seen by doctors because of cough and shortness of breath have also been reported. These patients were all heavy smokers and considered to have a form of interstitial lung disease. Most were in their 40s and had abnormalities in pulmonary function tests, most commonly reduced diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Their symptoms generally remained stable (did not worsen) over up to 10 years of follow-up. \n\n## Role of smoking\n\n To date, all reported patients with SRIF have been heavy current smokers or ex-smokers, lending credence to the assertion that this condition is caused by smoking. There are no published reports of SRIF in never-smokers. \n\n## Imaging findings\n\n Most cases of SRIF are not detectable clinically (clinically occult), and have no visible abnormalities on chest CT. In clinically occult cases, a range of findings have been described on CT, including no abnormalities, low attenuation areas, clustered cysts with visible walls, and ground-glass opacities with or without reticulation. In symptomatic patients, the radiologic features described on chest computed tomograms (chest CT, or CT scans of the chest) include bilateral ground-glass opacities (haziness in both lungs) and emphysema without reticulation, traction bronchiectasis or honeycombing. \n\n## Treatment and Prognosis\n\n There is very limited data on treatment and follow-up of smoking-related interstitial fibrosis. One study reported that corticosteroids were not beneficial. Smoking cessation resulted in stable/non-progressive disease after several years of follow-up. Improvements in pulmonary function tests with smoking cessation have also been documented.", "1964\u201365 City Cup": "The 1964\u201365 City Cup was the 60th edition of the City Cup, a cup competition in Northern Irish football.

It was an amateur photography club, yet influential force in the progressive photography scene in Kansai. They supported avant-garde creative tendencies including the Japanese \"New Photography\" movement, Shinko Shashin. As the leading member of the ACC, Nakayama Iwata released works in the \"Asahi Camera\" magazine that are through to be the first examples of the trend towards the Japanese Avant-garde Photography from the Japanese New Photography Movement. While Tokyo photographers shifted towards a photojournalistic approach under the influence of the Japanese government's efforts at controlling public opinion through photographs of Manchuria, Formosa, Korea and other Japanese colonial territories, amateur photography clubs in the Kansai region such as the ACC, Tampei Photography Club, Naniwa Photography Club, and others, tried to rebrand their experimental approaches to photography through the coinage of Avant-Garde Photography. Nakayama himself wrote in an article titled \"The Appearance of Avant-Garde Photography in Advertising Photography\" in \"Asahi Camera\" that Avant-Garde Photography was \"A photography that's searching for a new feeling, force or freshness... it resembles Shinko Shashin (The Japanese New Photography Movement) that is in common use.\" The Nakayama-led ACC and other Kansai-based photography clubs sustained their promotion of experimental photographic techniques marked by techniques such as photogram and photomontage influenced by European new photography movements such as Surrealism. The German \"Film und Foto\" exhibition was presented by \"Asahi Shimbum\" in Tokyo in 1931 and was hailed as one of the shows that introduced European New Photography movements to Japan. The ACC held their first Tokyo exhibition in the same exhibition hall as the \"Film und Foto\" exhibition just a few days later. The coincidence demonstrated the Japanese interpretation of New Photography and brought acclaim to the photographic activities of amateur photography clubs in the Kansai region. In 1935, the Ashiya Shashin Salon replaced the yearly Tokya exhibition of the group. Kanbei Hanaya was one of the leading members of the club. He traveled extensively around China and studied photography in Shanghai. He settled in Ashiya and bought a photo supply shop. This shop became the gathering place for photographers of the ACC. The ACC published the \"Ashiya Camera Club nankin\"(yearbook) in 1931. They also held the \"Ashiya Photography Salon\" which was an annual exhibition one to nationwide submissions in 1935 but was discontinued after the fifth exhibition in 1940 due to the changing societal atmosphere as the government clamped down on expressions that were deemed subversive in the years leading up WWII. \n\n## Exhibitions\n\n In 2022, the Tokyo Photographic Museum presented the exhibition \"Avant-Garde Rising: The Photographic Vanguard in Modern Japan\", which included the work of the Ashiya Camera Club.", "Al Suhub Rest House": "The Al Suhub Rest House is a tourist attraction in Khor Fakkan, on the East Coast of the Emirate of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.

Members of this tribe of grebes are characterized based on the presence of nuptial plumes and downy young with a bare crown patch. They are more specialized for diving though the anatomy that enables them to do so makes them weaker to stand upright. Further they have much complex mating dance rituals. Based on these characteristics, other possible genera in the clade include \"Poliocephalus\" and \"Rollandia\". Indeed a molecular phylogeny by Ogawa et al.

The building, which remains in use as a courthouse, is a Category B listed building. \n\n## History\n\n The first judicial building in Stirling was the tolbooth which, in its original form, dated from 1473. It was rebuilt in 1705, and augmented by a courthouse and prison block, designed by Richard Crichton, which was built to the south of the original building and completed in 1811. However, by the mid-19th century the old courthouse was considered inadequate and, following the implementation of the Sheriff Court Houses (Scotland) Act 1860, which laid down minimum standards for courthouses, the Commissioners of Supply decided to commission a new courthouse in Viewfield Place. The new building was designed in the Scottish baronial style by the architectural firm of Wardrop &amp; Reid based on an outline design by one of the firm's founders, Thomas Brown; it was built in ashlar stone and was completed in 1876. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of seven bays facing onto Viewfield Place with the end bays projected forward; the central section of five bays featured a portico formed by an arched opening with a hood mould flanked by pilasters supporting a balustraded parapet surmounted by gargoyles and crowns. There were tri-partite windows on either side of the portico, five bi-partite windows on the first floor and three dormer windows with shaped pediments at attic level. The outer bays were fenestrated by tri-partite windows on both floors with stepped gables above. There were bartizans, which were slightly set back, at the corners of the end bays and there were elaborate carvings involving cartouches supported by scrolls above the second and fourth bays of the centre section and also above the end bays. Internally, the principal room was a large courtroom on the first floor. A wooden canopy surmounted by a carved Royal coat of arms was installed above the judge's chair. A drinking fountain, carved from polished pink granite, was placed outside the courthouse in 1887. Stirlingshire County Council was established in 1890 and held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at the sheriff court, which was also known as \"County Buildings\" at the time. The county council continued to meet there until 1930 and had some of its offices in the building. In 1930 the county council's functions were substantially expanded under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929, taking over the functions of the abolished Stirlingshire Education Authority. The education authority had bought the former Royal Infirmary building at 33 Spittal Street in 1929 to use as its headquarters. The county council moved its meeting place to Spittal Street in 1930, but still needed more office space for its staff. In 1931 the council acquired a house called Viewforth on Pitt Terrace, which was subsequently extended and served as the county council's headquarters until its abolition in 1975. The sheriff court was extended to the north in a similar style to create a police station in 1912 and was extended to the rear in a modernist style to create additional courtroom space in the 1970s. It continued to serve a judicial function, being used for hearings of the sheriff's court and, on one day a month, for hearings of the justice of the peace court into the 21st century.", "Lycodes gracilis": "Lycodes gracilis, Vahl's eelpout or the gracile eelpout, is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Zoarcidae, the eelpouts.

The bridge consists of three stone arches. It is known to have been standing since the 13th century but was heavily rebuilt in 1771. Some of the stone for the bridge is believed to have come from Spon Gate, part of Coventry's historic city walls, which was among several of the city gates demolished in the late 18th century because they were impeding trade in and out of the city centre as the city grew. Other rumours suggest that the bridge contains stonework from Coventry's market cross.

Spon's boundaries were marked by Spon Gate in the east and Spon Bridge in the west, beyond which was a leper colony, later a hospital with a chapel.

In his youth, Zhang studied medicine and served in the army as an advisor. Following a successful career as a physician, he spent his final years in his native Zhejiang. \n\n## Early life\n\n Zhang was born in 1563 in Shanyin (now Shaoxing), Zhejiang. He moved to Shuntian, present-day Beijing, in his early teens, where his father had been posted to serve as an honorary advisor in the military. \n\n## Career\n\n In the capital, Zhang was tutored by physician Jin Mengshi (). He subsequently became a military advisor as well, and was briefly stationed in Korea, although his time in the army was generally uneventful. Returning home to pursue a full-time career as a physician, Zhang was noted for his approach to medicine, which was considered unorthodox at the time: instead of targeting the symptoms of an illness, he preferred to focus on its causes. He was able to treat illnesses that had hitherto confounded his fellow physicians and consequently earned much acclaim for his work.  Following the death of the Wanli Emperor in 1620, Zhang returned to Zhejiang, where he would pen several medical commentaries and treatises. His first book, \"Leijing\" (), examined the \"Huangdi neijing\" and was first published in 1624. According to 17th-century writer Huang Zongxi, the book was \"the most popular and valuable work on medicine in his day\". Zhang also wrote the medical encyclopedia \"Jingyue quanshu\" (), probably between 1620 and 1640; it was posthumously published by his grandson, who also wrote its foreword, in 1700. \n\n## Views\n\n According to Zhang, the ancient philosophical text \"Yijing\" was required reading for all physicians. He also tended to incorporate neo-Confucianist and Taoist ideas into his medical writings. In his earlier years, Zhang subscribed to a school of thought in Chinese medicine known as \"nourishing the \"yin\". However, around the age of 40, he began to take a keener interest in the \"yang\" component\" of the body, believing that good health came from the protection of organs such as the stomach and the spleen, which in turn required \"warming substances\" like tobacco. Zhang became one of the earliest and most influential advocates for tobacco smoking. He argued that tobacco smoke contained \"vitally warming and replenishing \"yang\" \"qi\"\" which would support the body's major organs and allow one to \"overcome a host of ailments\". On the other hand, Zhang recognised that tobacco had \"some pernicious intoxicating effects\". He cautioned against excessive smoking, recommending inhaling \"only one or two puffs at a time\".", "What You Say": "\"What You Say\" is a song by American rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again featuring The Kid Laroi and Post Malone, released on April 21, 2023, as the twenty-fourth track from his sixth full-length studio album,\u00a0\"Don't Try This at Home\".

Neumann's role as CEO and the cult of personality surrounding him are a major focus of the book. \n\n## Reception\n\n The book received mostly positive reviews from critics for its insight into WeWork's initial success and eventual devaluation. \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote that it was \"a thrilling page-turner about the fantastic success and subsequent crash of WeWork.\" Writing for the The New Republic, J.C. Pan described it as \"a definitive chronology of a company doomed not by one bad business strategy\u2014or even Neumann\u2019s outsize ego\u2014but by the rot of a postrecession economy that nurtured a certain flavor of investor-class mania.\" On the other hand, Walter Kirn described the book as a \"cautionary tale\" about Neumann.

The Revd Robert Graham of Netherby Hall made many improvements to his estate, and endeavoured to establish a salmon fishery, which involved building a weir in the river in 1770, and creating coops, which may have been holding pens for the fish. Coop House was built about 1772, probably as a vantage point for the salmon fishery. The weir collapsed in floods; an improved version designed by the civil engineer James Brindley also collapsed in 1782. The building is of red sandstone, and it originally consisted of one room with a projecting bay to view the river. Sir James Graham in the early 19th century added the flanking towers, each with a tall room on the ground floor and a small room above. After the failure of the weir it is thought to have been usually unoccupied. From the late 19th century it was a cottage for estate workers; in the 1930s it was a home for a shepherd and his family. It was later vacated, and by the 1980s it was collapsing.

Among the main legendary creatures and animals are The Mountain Fairy \"(Albanian:Zana e Malit)\", supernatural female mythological figures, and birds, which are able to speak like humans and aid or inform the main hero about the events that happened or will happen in the future. The songs are the product of a mountain tribal society in which blood kinship (Albanian: \"fis\") is the foundation, and the Kanun, a code of Albanian oral customary laws, direct all the aspects of the social organization.  In particular, peculiar traits of the two brothers and main characters of the epic cycle, Muji and Halili, are considered to be analogous to those of the Ancient Greek Dioscuri and their equivalents among the early Germans, Celts, Armenians, Indians, and other ancient peoples, who trace back to the common Proto-Indo-European Divine twins. The approximate timeline of events focus around the fight between Albanians and Slavic tribes during the Ottoman Period, but the stories are evolved variant of older mythological stories of Albania before the Ottoman occupation since there are similiar stories between Arb\u00ebresh population of Italy, like The Twins, which left Albania before The Ottoman Occupation. \n\n## Legend\n\n The legend is focused on the story of two brothers who spent their whole lives fighting with swords and spears. Muji's power was not supernatural until one day he drank milk from the Mountain Fairy. Muji became so strong that when a passer-by had asked him where a village was, Muji, who had been plowing the field, raised his hands along with the plow and pointed in the direction of that village. Muji's power was a contrast with his brother whose strongest skill was the agility. A formidable warrior he fought with swords, spears and bare handed. In order to protect their Albanian lands, they had fought against Krajl's \"(Slavic lord)\" soldiers and the Ottoman Sultan's vassals. His first deed was against Slavic bandits known as \"Harambash gangs\", which at that time had committed robberies, burnings and murders among the Albanian tribes.", "Emil W.

The book is \"based on the true story of Ruth and Jack Gruener,\" who were prisoners during the Holocaust. \"Prisoner B-3087\" was published by Scholastic Inc in 2013. \n\n## Summary\n\n Yanek Gruener is a ten-year-old boy living in Krak\u00f3w, Poland in 1939 when Adolf Hitler invades, at the beginning of World War II. Once the Nazi Party takes over the city, Yanek and his family are forced to live in the Krakow Ghetto, with other Jewish families. For three years, Yanek lived in cramped small two-bedroom apartments housing 20 people of different families, watching other families and loved ones being taken to different concentration camps, knowing they were not returning. When Yanek was thirteen years old,\u00a0he and his uncle were taken to the Plaszow Concentration Camp, where they worked in the tailor shops making uniforms for the German soldiers and fellow prisoners. While in Plaszow, Yanek and his uncle hid under a loose floorboard to escape work detail, and is later said by Yanek (also known as Jake or Jacob) that he truly believes that hiding is what saved him, for if he could survive Amon Goeth then he could survive it all. After the death of his uncle, he was employed through the concentration camp to work in an enamelware factory by a man named Oskar Schindler. Sadly, he was transferred away from Plaszow three months before Schindler started to save the Jewish prisoners who worked in his factory. After one year in the Plaszow Concentration Camp, Yanek was moved to the Wieliczka Salt Mine and worked in the mines for a short time until he was moved to Trzebinia Concentration Camp. The Nazi soldiers and Kapos\u00a0treated the prisoners like a game. Yanek spent his days digging pits for his fellow prisoners when they inevitably died. After less than a year in Trzebinia, Yanek and the other prisoners were shoved into cattle cars and transported to Birkenau Concentration camp. Once he arrived, Yanek and the other Jewish prisoners were led into the shower. Believing they were to die, they started to yell at the guards, telling them not to waste time and kill them already. Instead, they were met with water, after which they were given new clothes and shoes. Yanek got his B-3087 tattoo. While in Birkenau, Yanek stood with a 10 year old boy during his bar mitzvah and worked to keep himself alive until he was moved from Birkenau sister camp Auschwitz. Yanek and fellow prisoners walked to his sixth concentration camp Auschwitz stopping along the way to pick up more Jewish prisoners. There, he was moved to the right by Dr. Mengele along with the rest of the men. After surviving Auschwitz, he was part of a two week long death march to Sechsenhausen Concentration Camp. Shortly after arriving, he was forced back into a cattle car and sent to Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp. There, due to their poor health and weak bodies, the Nazi official ordered all the Jewish prisoners not to work for a week and instead eat and regain their strength. Shortly after that, he was shoved back into a cattle car and sent off to Buchenwald Concentration Camp. Unlike the other concentration camps, Buchenwald was open to the public as a zoo, ran by Karl Koch and his wife, nicknamed \"the witch of Buchenwald\". After surviving the witch of Buchenwald, Yanek was once again placed in a cattle car and sent to Gross-Rosen Concentration Camp, where he lost a button on his jacket and got 20 lashes before he was sent on his second death march. This time he was sent to Dachau Concentration camp, his tenth one, where he was eventually saved from imprisonment by American soldiers. \n\n## Themes\n\n Gratz discussed various concentration camps that the main character spent time at throughout WW2: Gratz introduces significant people from this time such as Amon Goeth, Dr. Mengele, Karl Koch, Ilse Koch, and Oskar Schindler. \n\n## Reception\n\n \"Prisoner B-3087\" is a Junior Library Guild book. \"Kirkus Reviews\" called \"Prisoner B-3087\" \"a bone-chilling tale not to be ignored by the universe.\" \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote that Gratz's \"determination to be exhaustively inclusive, along with lapses into History Channel\u2013like prose, threatens to overwhelm the story. But more often, Gratz ably conveys Yanek\u2019s incredulity ..., fatalism, yearning, and determination in the face of the unimaginable.\" Debra Gold, writing for the Jewish Book Council noted, \"The language, sparse yet provocative, draws the reader in and, like Night by Elie Wiesel, poignantly shows the darkness of the Holocaust with always the possibility of hope and survival.\" Bank Street College of Education named \"Prisoner B-3087\" one of the best books of 2014 for children ages 12-14.", "Dhondi Champya - Ek Prem Katha": "Dhondi Champya - Ek Prem Katha is an Indian Marathi language movie. starring Bharat Jadhav and Vaibhav Mangale, Nikhil Chavan, Sayli Patil in the lead. directed by Dnyanesh Bhalekar.

Most of the work on organothorium compounds has focused on the cyclopentadienyls and cyclooctatetraenyls. Like many of the early and middle actinides (thorium through americium, and also expected for curium), thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex , thorocene. It is isotypic with the more well-known analogous uranium compound, uranocene. Although these f-series cyclooctatetraenyls are not isotypic with the d-series cyclopentadienyls, including the more famous ferrocene, they have very similar structures, and were named to emphasise this resemblance. It can be prepared by reacting K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at the temperature of dry ice, or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. It is an unstable compound in air and outright decomposes in water or at 190\u00a0\u00b0C. Half-sandwich compounds are also known, such as 2(\"\u03b7\"&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)ThCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran. The simplest of the cyclopentadienyls are and : many derivatives are known. The first (which has two forms, one purple and one green) is a rare example of thorium in the formal +3 oxidation state. In the derivative [Th&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;{\"\u03b7\"&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], a blue paramagnetic compound, the molecular geometry is trigonal planar around the thorium atom, which has a [Rn]6d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; configuration instead of the expected [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. [Th&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;{\"\u03b7\"&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] can be reduced to the anion [Th&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;{\"\u03b7\"&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;\u2212&lt;/sup&gt;, in which thorium exhibits a very rare +2 oxidation state. The second is prepared by heating thorium tetrachloride with under reflux in benzene: the four cyclopentadienyl rings are arranged tetrahedrally around the central thorium atom. The halide derivative can be made similarly by reducing the amount of used (other univalent metal cyclopentadienyls can also be used), and the chlorine atom may be further replaced by other halogens or by alkoxy, alkyl, aryl, or BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; groups. Of these, the alkyl and aryl derivatives have been investigated more deeply due to the insight they give regarding the nature of the Th\u2013C \u03c3 bond. Of special interest is the dimer [Th(\"\u03b7\"&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-\"\u03bc\"-(\"\u03b7\"&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;,\"\u03b7\"&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the two thorium atoms are bridged by two cyclopentadienyl rings, similarly to the structure of niobocene. Tetrabenzylthorium, , is known, but its structure has not yet been determined.

With the rise of the folklore movement by the end of the 1970s these traditions were revived, and there are several folkloric groups that are trying to reconstruct these, in cooperation with researchers. \u0136ekatas (\u0136ekatas ie\u0161ana, \"stilt walking\", \"stilt strolling\") is a Latvian folk tradition of masked processions. The participants, called \u0136ekatnieki (singular: \u0136ekatnieks) wearing various masks went from one homestead to another giving blessings and driving away evil spirits. Since the old times they happened in autumn and winter, when all farmers' work is done any time from St. Martin's Day to Mete\u0146i, depending on the region. The tradition is also associated with Christmas time, similar to mummering-like traditions in other places. In fact, one of the names of the mask procession tradition is ka\u013cadas, borrowed from Slavic Koleda. Other names used in other parts of Latvia include bud\u0113\u013ci and \u010dig\u0101nos ie\u0161ana (gypsy walking). These traditions differ not only by the name, but the behavior as well. Masks represented evil beings, animals, objects (haystack, sheaf), people, often stereotyped (little man and tall woman, pauper/beggar, gypsy, Jew) The gypsy walking, mostly with gypsy masks, but also with other \u0136ekatas masks is also associated with festivals and wedding parties. The name of the Zemgale tradition \"bud\u0113\u013ci\" comes from the word \"bud\u012bt\", \"budin\u0101t\" - to awaken, arouse, and the meaning of the tradition is to awaken the nature and people during the spring holiday of Mete\u0146i to a new life cycle.

It is an erect, bushy shrub with elliptic to lance-shaped or oblong leaves, and white, tube-shaped flowers usually arranged singly in upper leaf axils. \n\n## Description\n\n \"Leucopogon leptospermoides\" is an erect, bushy shrub that typically grows to a height of , and has softly-hairy branchlets. The leaves are more or less erect, elliptic to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, or oblong, long and wide on a petiole long. The leaves are glabrous and the lower surface is finely striated. The flowers are arranged singly in upper leaf axils with white bracteoles long at the base. The sepals are long, the petals joined at the base to form a tube long with lobes long. Flowering mainly occurs from September to November and the fruit is a glabrous, oval drupe long. \n\n## Taxonomy\n\n \"Leucopogon leptospermoides\" was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown in his \"Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen\". The specific epithet (\"leptospermoides\") means \"leptospermum-like\". \n\n## Distribution and habitat\n\n This leucopogon grows in coastal heath and open woodland in Queensland to as far south as Hawks Nest on the north coast of New South Wales.", "Dante Alighieri Square": "Dante Alighieri Square is the oldest and most traditional public square in Caxias do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, located in the center of the city. It was included in the colony's floor plan from the beginning of the territory's occupation and was the stage for many important events, having in its surroundings several historical buildings of great importance. \n\n## History\n\n The creation of a square in Caxias do Sul had been planned since the foundation of the Italian colony, in 1875, in the same place where it is today. In its origin, its topography was different, being a much more elevated place than it is now. Until 1880, there are no reports of any improvements; the area was unpaved and the incipient urbanization in the surrounding area advanced over some of its stretches. These structures were removed in 1882 after a change in the urban land use plan was approved, which included the realignment of its delimiting streets. Soon the urbanization work began, with the construction of some railings for fences and commercial buildings, hotels, and recreational houses in the surroundings, shaping what would be the current Historic Center of Caxias do Sul. Some kiosks were set up in the area of the square to sell drinks and different snacks, as well as, eventually, circuses and groceries, defining itself as a meeting and socializing place for the population. During the administration of Jos\u00e9 Pena de Moraes, plans were drawn up for improvements, and the level of the area was lowered after the removal of 1,200 m\u00b3 of rocks. The square was gardened, received benches and a fence, a retaining wall on the alignment of J\u00falio de Castilhos Street, the sidewalks were paved, and the monuments to J\u00falio de Castilhos, a work by Prosperi, and to Dante Alighieri, a work by the Italian Eugenio Bellotto, were installed. A bandstand was also erected for speeches by authorities and band performances. In 1917, the square received the Municipal Chalet, a masonry replica of the traditional wooden kiosks, with a bar, restaurant, and game rooms. In 1922, on the centenary of Brazil's Independence, a monument to Liberty was inaugurated, containing a statue by Michelangelo Zambelli and a pedestal by Silvio Toigo. In 1927, more leveling and improvement work began, which lasted until 1940, and included new landscaping with a profusion of rose bushes, the construction of a fountain, and the paving of the alleys with stone mosaics. Meanwhile, on August 27, 1933, in front of the Cathedral, the cornerstone of the monument to the Duke of Caxias was laid. During World War II, with the wave of xenophobia that spread through Brazil, the name of the square was changed to Rui Barbosa Square, after violent popular demonstrations. In the 1970s, a new fountain was installed and the square was enlarged, absorbing a stretch of J\u00falio de Castilhos Avenue, which was transformed into a sidewalk. In 1990, the government proposed rehabilitating the memory of Dante Alighieri, restoring the square's old name, which occurred on June 12. In the beginning of the 21st century, the stretch of sidewalk was again opened to vehicular traffic, and the place was completely re-paved. \n\n## Conservation\n\n Due to its antiquity, and for having been the stage of remarkable events in community life since the beginning of colonization, including hosting several of the first Grape Festivals, the square has become full of memories. However, these traditions are quickly being lost in the face of the fast-paced progress that the city is experiencing, as well as receiving a large new population from other regions. Today, the square preserves a very similar configuration to the one established in the 1940s, but its surroundings, formed by historic buildings, suffered a profound loss of characteristics throughout the 20th century, losing notable constructions such as the old headquarters of the Banco Nacional do Com\u00e9rcio, the Pezzi Hotel, and the first headquarters of the Intendency. In the last decades, its remains have been further decharacterized by arbitrary renovations and by large advertising boards installed on the facades, which hide most of its elements. However, the City Hall has developed some revitalization programs, such as \"Caminhos da Mem\u00f3ria\" (English: Memory Paths), which include the square, as well as a legislation that protects buildings that are more than 50 years old. In addition, several properties in the surroundings have been listed as municipal heritage, legislation that minimizes the impacts of visual pollution on the buildings in the Historic Center has been implemented, and slowly, the population seems to be waking up to the importance of preserving the local patrimony, although there is still a lot of work to be done to prevent new disfigurement from occurring, as the ones that recently occurred in the cathedral and in the Canonical House, the two most relevant historic buildings that still survive in the surroundings, but that have not yet been listed as municipal heritage. The square still preserves several plaques commemorating illustrious citizens of Caxias and important events, as well as the city's \"marco zero\". Other significant buildings in the surroundings are the Scotti House, the Sassi House, and the headquarters of the Clube Juvenil.", "Atrik": "Atrik () is a rural locality (a selo) in Urginsky Selsoviet, Khivsky District, Republic of Dagestan, Russia.

On the occasion of the group's 150th anniversary, on 1 November 2013, they repeated the two compositions that had been sung for the first performance. The choir was dedicated as a gift a composition commissioned for the occasion, Naji Hakim's setting of Psalm 122, \"Laetatus sum\" (I was glad). It was written for a four-part choir, two organs and optionally the cathedral's bell. \n\n## Tours\n\n The first transatlantic tour of the K\u00f6lner Domchor was in 2002 to the United States and Canada.

He was killed in action at the Battle of Gettysburg while leading a pursuit of retreating Confederates at the edge of The Wheatfield. He was the brother of author Bayard Taylor.  \n\n## Early life and family\n\n Taylor was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania, on February 6, 1840, to Joseph and Rebecca (Way) Taylor. His family was of English Quaker and German descent, and at the time of his death, his father was completing a three-year term as sheriff of Chester County, of which West Chester was the county seat. Shortly after his birth, the Taylors returned to their family farm called Hazeldell near Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, where Taylor grew up and attended school. \"Fred\" Taylor was the youngest of six children who survived into adulthood. His three brothers included the celebrated poet and traveler Bayard Taylor, Union Army Colonel William W. Taylor, and Union Army surgeon John Howard Taylor. His sisters included Annie Taylor Carey, who stepped in to manage the family farm, and Emma Taylor Lamborn. \n\n## Education and farming\n\n In the fall of 1855, Taylor entered the University of Michigan. He took a sabbatical to accompany his brother Bayard and his sisters on a grand tour of England, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy between July 1856 and June 1857. He learned German and French and resumed his studies in the fall of 1857 but withdrew from Michigan at the end of the spring of 1858 to manage Hazeldell, seeking to make the farm self-sustaining through innovative agricultural methods. With financial aid from Bayard, he was making progress as a farmer when the Civil War erupted in 1861. \n\n## American Civil War\n\n In response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for three-month volunteers to suppress Southern secessionists, Taylor organized a company of Kennett volunteers on April 20, 1861. Marching to Camp Curtin near Harrisburg, they formed Company H in the 42nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry (or the 13th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment). The 21-year-old Taylor was unanimously elected captain. The regiment saw little action in the early months of the war. Four companies, including Taylor's, were detailed to fight in the Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1862, attached to George Dashiell Bayard's flying brigade. On June 6, 1862, Taylor fought in his first battle at Good's Farm near Harrisonburg, Virginia, where he was captured while leading a rearguard action. His regiment's lieutenant colonel, Thomas L. Kane, was wounded and also captured. Both officers were soon paroled, and Taylor spent the next four months in Annapolis, Maryland, waiting to be formally exchanged before he could rejoin his regiment. During this period, Lieutenant Colonel Kane received a promotion to brigadier general, and Colonel Hugh W. McNeil was killed at the Battle of Antietam (the previous colonel, Charles John Biddle, had resigned in December 1861 to enter Congress). Taylor returned to his regiment as acting commander in time to fight in the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, where 190 out of 300 soldiers of the 13th who fought in the battle became casualties in frontal attacks on entrenched Confederate positions. Taylor was wounded in the shoulder, and his horse was shot out from under him. Posted to defend Washington while his regiment recovered from its losses, Taylor received his anticipated promotion to full colonel on March 1, 1863. Taylor's next and final battle was the Battle of Gettysburg. The 13th deployed to defend Little Round Top on July 2, 1863. Late in the afternoon that day, Taylor, on foot, led a charge down the hill across Plum Run, drove back the Confederates from a stone wall and through the Rose Woods to the edge of The Wheatfield, with the Bucktails in hot pursuit. Taylor with twenty other soldiers got ahead of the main Union advance and halted, only to be struck suddenly by gunfire from Confederate reinforcements. A bullet pierced Taylor's heart, and he died on the spot two minutes later. His regiment suffered a total of seven men killed, 39 wounded, and two missing at Gettysburg. Taylor died at the age of 23. His remains were returned to Kennett Square and interred at Longwood Cemetery on July 8, 1863. At Annapolis he had become engaged to Alice Green, whose father was a slaveholder. Green attended his funeral, but Taylor's family disapproved of the engagement and destroyed their letters after his death. \n\n## Legacy\n\n Taylor was the youngest colonel in the Army of the Potomac at the time of his death. His commanding officer, Brigadier General Samuel W. Crawford, praised him as \"the gallant and brave leader of the Bucktail Regiment\" who \"fell while leading his regiment to the charge. No braver soldier and patriot has given his life for his cause.\" On October 6, 1905, the Regimental Association of the Bucktails dedicated a granite marker on the exact spot where Taylor fell.", "Donaldo Ross": "Donaldo Ross (1904 \u2013 1972) was a Uruguayan football player and manager. \n\n## Early and personal life\n\n Ross was born in 1904 in Montevideo.

Two variants have been detected in humans.  \n\n## Superfamily\n\n BPIFB3 is a member of a BPI fold protein superfamily defined by the presence of the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein fold (BPI fold) which is formed by two similar domains in a \"boomerang\" shape. This superfamily is also known as the BPI/LBP/PLUNC family or the BPI/LPB/CETP family. The BPI fold creates apolar binding pockets that can interact with hydrophobic and amphipathic molecules, such as the acyl carbon chains of lipopolysaccharide found on Gram-negative bacteria, but members of this family may have many other functions.  Genes for the BPI/LBP/PLUNC superfamily are found in all vertebrate species, including distant homologs in non-vertebrate species such as insects, mollusks, and roundworms. Within that broad grouping is the BPIF gene family whose members encode the BPI fold structural motif and are found clustered on a single chromosome, e.g., Chromosome 20 in humans, Chromosome 2 in mouse, Chromosome 3 in rat, Chromosome 17 in pig, Chromosome 13 in cow. The BPIF gene family is split into two groupings, BPIFA and BPIFB. In humans, BIPFA consists of 3 protein encoding genes \"BPIFA1\", \"BPIFA2\", \"BPIFA3\", and 1 pseudogene \"BPIFA4P\"; while BPIFB consists of 5 protein encoding genes \"BPIFB1\", \"BPIFB2\", \"BPIFB3\", \"BPIFB4\", \"BPIFB6\" and 2 pseudogenes \"BPIFB5P\", \"BPIFB9P\". What appears as pseudogenes in humans may appear as fully functional genes in other species. \"BPIFB3\" was first directly identified in a screen of rat olfactory epithelium as \"RYA3\" and was recognized to be a member of the BPI fold superfamily. In humans, it was formerly known as \"Long palate, lung and nasal epithelium carcinoma-associated protein 3\" encoded by the \"LPLUNC3\" gene. The \"BPIFB3\" gene is found with other members of the BPIF gene family in a cluster on chromosome 20. \n\n## Function\n\n BPIFB3/RYA3 is highly expressed in olfactory epithelium and the tongue, within the cytoplasm of cells, and is thought to be similar to an odorant binding protein which presents odorant molecules to chemical odorant receptor molecules.  Like other BPI-fold family members involved in defense from infection, BPIFB3 may be involved in responses to viral infections such as the enteroviruses coxsackievirus B and poliovirus in epithelial and endothelial tissue. Its cytoplasmic location appears to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and influences the replication of coxsackievirus B; when BPIFB3 is knocked out in experimental systems coxsackievirus B replication dramatically increases. It has been within observed in the ER to be physically associated with another family member, BPIFB6, and modulation of either of these two proteins can enhance or suppress enteroviral release from cells.

She died on 7 March 1988 in Hammond, Illinois.", "Habshi dynasty": "Habshi dynasty refers to the rule of Ethiopian Abyssinian rulers in Bengal that lasted from 1487 to 1493 or 1494 during the Bengal Sultanate. Four Habshi rulers ruled Bengal during this period. This rule began with the rebellion against and assassination of Jalaluddin Fateh Shah of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty. \n\n## Background\n\n Before the Ilyas Shahi dynasty, it was customary for Muslim rulers to purchase Abyssinian slaves and appoint them to royal palaces or important positions in the kingdom. Even during the reign of Jalaluddin Fateh Shah, some slaves were appointed as palace guards, who gradually increased their power among themselves. Jalaluddin tried to rein them in. But the Habshis rebelled under the leadership of Shahzada Barbak and killed the Sultan and seized the throne. \n\n## Reign\n\n \n\n## Shahzada Barbak\n\n Shahzada Barbak killed Jalaluddin Fateh Shah in 1487 and assumed the rule. He took the royal name \"Ghiyasuddin Shahzada Barbak\". As his reign was short-lived, he was able to start few coins. A few months after his accession to the throne, Ilyas Shahi's loyal Malik Andil Khan killed him and took the throne. \n\n## Saifuddin Feroz Shah\n\n Andil Habshi or Saifuddin Firuz Shah ruled Bengal for two years. He killed Barbak and took the throne. He is credited by many as the main founder of Habshi rule. Because Barbak ruled for a short time. He was reportedly impotent. He was generous and kind. He ruled from 1487 to 1489. According to most historians, he died a natural death. However, according to some historians like Ghulam Husain Salim and Jadunath, he was also killed by one of the palace guards. \n\n## Mahmud Shah II\n\n Mahmud Shah II was the adopted son of Saifuddin Firuz Shah. He took over as an infant. His royal regent was Habash Khan. After a year in 1490, Sidi Badr killed him and Habash Khan and took over the rule. \n\n## Shamsuddin Mozaffar Shah\n\n Shamsuddin Muzaffar Shah or Sidi Badr was the Abyssinian ruler who ruled Bengal for the longest time. Intent on capturing Bengal, he first killed Habash Khan, the royal regent of Sultan Mahmud Shah II, before proceeding to assassinate the Sultan. Badr Shams-ud-Din ascended the throne assuming the title of Muzaffar Shah. He raised an army of thirty thousand soldiers; Among them were thousands of Afghans and five thousand Abyssinians. He defeated the Kamata kingdom in battle and conquered their territory in 1492/92. In 1494 his wazir (chief minister) Sayyed Hussain led a revolt in which he was killed. \n\n## Fall and Legacy\n\n Due to political instability and a lack of capacity to deal with injustices, Habashi rule eventually fell. Although Saifuddin Firuz Shah was compassionate, but he could not spread that much power. On the contrary, Shamsuddin M\u099czaffar Shah, who was focused on expanding his power, was also focused on empowering the Abyssinians in Bengal. Described by Indo-Persian historians as a tyrant, his cruelty was said to have alienated the nobility as well as his common subjects. In 1494, a rebellion led by Syed Hussain led to the death of Shamsuddin Mozaffar Shah. Syed Hossain ascended the throne with the name Alauddin Husain Shah. He expelled all the Abyssinians from power and banished the Abyssinians from the area. Eventually the Habashis were forced to move to different areas of the Deccan and Gujarat.", "BatAAr": "BatAAr was a band from Gothenburg, Sweden, active between 2005-2019. \n\n## Group\n\n BatAAr was founded in Gothenburg, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland, Sweden. BatAAr had four members; Endigo (vocals), Patrik (guitar), Simon (guitar), and Tobias (drums). \n\n## History\n\n Going all the way back to 2005, BatAAr started when school mates Simon and Patrik, both being musicians on their own, decided to start work together. Tobias joined shortly thereafter and the trio kept playing together throughout their remaining school years. They completed the full 5-piece lineup and thus BatAAr's first EP \"ABSORB\" was released in early 2011. The EP, mastered by G\u00f6ran Finnberg gained instant nationwide traction, with radio airplay and live shows across the country. Following the EP, the bands desired for originality and started incorporating streaks of typical Japanese Visual Kei style resulting in vivid looks in their music videos, outfits and live shows. In addition, the band started a close collaboration with Swedish success studio Top Floor Studios run by renowned producer, and Verge family member Jakob Herrmann and Danish mixing engineer Tue Madsen. Japan was one of BatAAr's steadiest bases, with annual tours following, each extensively larger in scope than the last, and multiple sold out shows each tour. They also coined the term Art Metal for their brand of diverse soundscapes fused with the aesthetic style and attention to detail found in Japanese visual kei. Following the recent success, the band released their first mini-album titled 'MEMORIA' in 2014. This album was a compilation of previously released singles combined with a slew of new songs. For the release of \"MEMORIA\", BatAAr signed a deal with 'FWD Inc' \u2013 Japans most prominent Visual Kei record label, which is the only non-Japanese act to ever sign a deal with. 2015 was a year of re-evaluation for the band. The core trio of Patrik, Simon and Tobias decided that BatAAr was ready to take the next huge leap as a band. This resulted in the recruitment of long-time friend Endigo, another pioneer of Visual Rock in the western music scene, who would go on to become the new vocalist of the band. In January 2016, the band officially launched the rebooted BatAAr with the release of the two-track single \"REBIRTH\" featuring re-recorded versions of the tracks 'THE DISTANCE' and \"RISKBREAKER\" with Endigo's vocals. Shortly thereafter, the band released their first Endigo-fronted single and music video, titled \"ALWAYS DIE YOUNG\". This release was a success among fans and industry people, quickly gaining over 10.000 hits within its first week in the market. During the production of the fighting game \"Tekken 7\", series director Katsuhiro Harada was impressed by the band, and felt the game could benefit from their songs. The group originally met Harada during a Twitter conversation when one of the band members asked him where he could buy a \"Tekken\" action figure in Tokyo. Harada invited the group to dine with him and presented them with his idea. As the character Lars Alexanderssson is half-Swedish, he asked the band to compose the character's theme song, which he hoped fans of the franchise would look forward to hearing when playing the character. The group then went to Japanese arcades to play \"Tekken 7\" as Lars while listening to their own music, which they found fitting. Honored by the proposal, the band said Harada had given them complete freedom as long as the song included Swedish lyrics to fit Lars' nationality. Band member Patrik, responsible for writing the lyrics, made extensive research about Lars' role in the \"Tekken\" series, as well as fan theories about him, in an attempt to understand Lars' characterization in \"Tekken 7\" and make the lyrics fit. BatAAr's theme song for Lars was ultimately titled \"Vrede\" (Swedish for \"Wrath\"), and included in both a CD single as well as the original soundtrack of \"Tekken 7\". The band took a liking to Lars to the point where all the band members played \"Tekken 7\"s tournament mode as him, singing \"Vrede\" during pauses. VGMOnline described VREDE as a \"tune definitely fits the heavy metal bill, featuring guttural vocals and heavy rock\".

Currently, the port is part of the complex managed by the Association of the Ports of Paranagu\u00e1 and Antonina (APPA). In the 1920s it was considered the 4th largest port in exports in Brazil.  Located in a strategic point for the flow of production, the Port of Antonina extends the agility and quality of services of the Port of Paranagu\u00e1, offering two port terminals: The Bar\u00e3o de Teff\u00e9 and the Ponta do F\u00e9lix. \n\n## History\n\n In 1856, the first pier was built in Antonina, establishing the regular line of steamboats from Antonina to Paranagu\u00e1. In 1870, the Admiral Baron of Teff\u00e9, Ant\u00f4nio Lu\u00eds von Hoonholtz, interceded for the railroad that would link Antonina with the Ministry of Agriculture, Commerce, and Public Works. In 1880, Pedro II arrived at Antonina with his entourage on board of the ship \"Rio Grande\". Two years later, the railroad branch between Antonina and Morretes was inaugurated, improving the logistics of the port.  In 1904, the Matarazzo family acquired land in the city to build the Matarazzo Industrial Complex, intensifying the economic activity in the region. In 1917, the port facilities were completed, including industrial buildings and houses for the port employees. In 1926, the port of Antonina was considered the main port in the transportation of mate. In overall exports, it became the fourth-largest in Brazil. However, in the 1930s, such transportation decreased with the fall in production. In the next decade, with the Second World War, the port lost strength and importance. In 1958, the Port Captaincy building was inaugurated there. In 1960, coffee exports were allowed through the terminal. At that time the port had 318 stevedores. In 1971, a new administrative proposal emerged and the port of Antonina joined the port of Paranagu\u00e1, under the Administration of the ports of Paranagu\u00e1 and Antonina. Still, in the 1970s, the Matarazzo Complex faced a strong crisis and decided, in 1972, to close down activities in Antonina. In 1989, the terminal of Antonina started receiving cargoes of fertilizer and salt and in 1992 the government of Paran\u00e1 started dredging the access channel to the port. In 1999, the cargo terminals at Ponta do Felix started operating and two years later the refrigerated terminal was inaugurated. In 2011, the Port of Antonina recovered its cargo handling, as an alternative to the unloading of fertilizers. \n\n## Data\n\n The port currently has two terminals, the Bar\u00e3o de Teff\u00e9, and the Ponta do F\u00e9lix, the latter with an area of 2.839.519 thousand square feet (263.8 thousand square meters) and two berths in 1180 feet (360 meters) of dock. The main cargoes that pass through the terminals are frozen foods, fertilizers, and iron ore. The current import capacity is 2 million tons with projections to double this capacity to 4 million tons. In 2013, the port recorded 1.573.406 tons of shipped volume. With dredging work in 2014, the port now allows ships up to 45,000 tons. In 2015, a private investment of 160 million reais (approximately 30 million dollars) was announced over the next few years, including the construction of a new berth at the Ponta do F\u00e9lix Terminal and two new 120,000-ton warehouses.", "Dipsas copei": "Dipsas copei is a non-venomous snake found in Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Venezuela.", "Guttigadus squamirostre": "Guttigadus squamirostre, is a cod is a member of the family Moridae, the morid cods, related to the true cods (of genus \"Gadus\", family Gadidae).

According to a review by author Joyce Carol Oates, \"Miss Cullinan is always intelligent, precise and skillful, turning out stories of near\u2010faultless craftsmanship.\" \n\n## Themes in her work\n\n Cullinan's work centres on the lives of working class Irish-Americans, many of them based in Manhattan and The Bronx, and the concerns of \"newly post-Vatican II Irish American Catholics\". Her fiction explores Catholics grappling with the sexual revolution and the tensions between a still-pious older generation and young people alienated from religion in a secular world. Several stories explore the changing roles of women in the 1960s. Many of her characters are Manhattan women with careers, who reject domesticity and find work \"creative and sustaining\". According to Professor Patricia Coughlan of University College Cork, Cullinan \"resists assumptions that women\u2019s concerns and experience are supplementary to men\u2019s\". She helped redefine Irish-American literature, moving away from the male tradition of \"ward bosses and henchmen\". \n\n## Later life and death\n\n Cullinan moved to Towson, Maryland in 2015 to be closer to family. She died from lung disease on 26 January 2020 at a retirement community there, aged 86. \n\n## Works\n\n \"House of Gold\", by Elizabeth Cullinan (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin, 1970), 328 pp. \"The Time of Adam\", by Elizabeth Cullinan (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin, 1971), 178 pp. \"Yellow Roses\", by Elizabeth Cullinan (New York: Viking Press, 1977), 208 pp. \"A Change of Scene\", by Elizabeth Cullinan (New York: W.W.

It is variously dated from the late 1520s to the 1540s. The painting is in the collection of the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska. \n\n## History\n\n The Joslyn Art Museum dates this portrait to the late 1520s and attributes it to Titian alone, although this attribution is not accepted by some modern scholars. According to Georg Gronau, it was painted in Titian's middle period, about 1530 to 1540. The work was \"sadly damaged\" by the time it went to the United States in the early 1900s, and some students of Venetian art then thought it a copy. Charles Ricketts thought this impression was due mainly to the repainting, in brown, of the background, formerly grey, with the consequent weakening of the contours and falsifying of the shadows; and the reduction in the quality of the pigment by ironing or relining. Extensive conservation work was completed by senior conservator Mark Leonard at the Getty Museum in 2008. \n\n## Provenance\n\n The picture was formerly in Castle Howard, Yorkshire. It was sold to the private collector E. F. Milliken of New York some time before 1904. The painting was purchased by the Josyln Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska in the early 1940s and has remained there since. \n\n## Description\n\n Turning with animation to the right, the sitter is trying a falcon which he holds on his left hand. The head is slightly thrown back, the right side, together with the right hand, which is feeling the falcon, is placed in strong light. A neutral grey background, somewhat lighter close round the figure, sets in strong relief the form attired in black. The head of a pointer can be seen, just appearing in the left-hand lower corner, gazing up at his master. \n\n## Analysis\n\n Although it is not known for certain, the subject of the painting may be Giorgio Cornaro the Younger (1517\u20131571), from the prominent Venetian Cornaro family; or possibly one of Titian\u2019s princely patrons, as the Duke of Mantua.", "2023 European Wrestling Championships \u2013 Women's freestyle 72 kg": "The women's freestyle 72\u00a0kg is a competition featured at the 2023 European Wrestling Championships, and will held in Zagreb, Croatia on April 20 and 21.", "Indian Peak (Catron County, New Mexico)": "Indian Peak is located in the Gila Wilderness in Catron County, New Mexico.

His father Leo was a mill worker and later worked for the Postal Service. His mother Dorothy (n\u00e9e Wilkinson) also worked in a mill. He was survived by a brother named Joe. Joe described Pawtucket as \"gloomy\" and said that Michael \"retreated into books at an early age\". \n\n## Education and career\n\n Denneny graduated from the University of Chicago with a bachelor's degree in history in 1967. He then continued with graduate studies at the school's Committee on Social Thought under philosopher Hannah Arendt.  Denneny moved to New York City in 1971 after the Stonewall riots and was shorty thereafter hired at Macmillan. There he published a book version of Ntozake Shange\u2019s feminist play \"for colored girls who have considered suicide/ when the rainbow is enuf\". In 1976, he and Chuck Ortleb started the gay literary magazine \"Christopher Street\". According to Denneny, shortly before it started publishing several top gay men who were not open about their gayness subtly threatened to end his career if his name appeared in the magazine. In 1977, Denneny was fired by Macmillan when it was learned that he was going to publish \"The Homosexuals\" by Alan Ebert which contained interviews with gay men. He was briefly rehired to present the book at a sales conference because it was subsequently to be published due to legal obligations, but when his connection to Christopher Street became apparent he was fired again. During this time he worked on the gay publication the New York Native in addition to Christopher Street. After applying for a large number of jobs at Manhattan publishers while openly admitting to being gay, in 1977 he was hired at St. Martin's Press, and wrote two books of his own, \"Lovers\" and \"Decent Passions\".

Like its closest relatives, \"Pelodiscus huangshanensis\" and \"Pelodiscus axenaria\", the species is endemic to China. Especially \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" is morphologically similar to \"Pelodiscus shipian\", and these species may have been confused with each other in the past; \"Pelodiscus shipian\" was described only in 2022. \n\n## Etymology\n\n In Fengxin County, the local name for \"Pelodiscus shipian\" is \"shi pian bie\" (\u77f3\u7247\u9c49), meaning \"stone slab soft-shelled turtle\". The name refers to the turtle looking like a flat stone. The species epithet \"shipian\" is derived from the first part of the local Chinese name, \"shi pian\" (\u77f3\u7247), meaning \"slab\". The describers of \"Pelodiscus shipian\" suggested an English name for the turtle, Chinese stone slab soft-shelled turtle. \n\n## Taxonomy\n\n \"Pelodiscus shipian\" belongs to the genus \"Pelodiscus\", which was previously lumped together as a single species, \"Pelodiscus sinensis\". In 1991, a new species of the genus was described as \"Pelodiscus axenaria\", but its distinctiveness was often questioned until it was confirmed by molecular genetic studies in 2010. In 2018, Shiping Gong and colleagues discovered a genetically distinct lineage of the \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" complex. They initially called it \"lineage I\", until they described it as a new species, \"Pelodiscus shipian\", in 2022. Some older records of \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" may actually represent \"Pelodiscus shipian\". The \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" complex also includes \"Pelodiscus huangshanensis\", which was described in 2021. After Gong and colleagues discovered the cryptic \"lineage I\", another group of researchers also began collecting and studying specimens of the new lineage. They wrote a species description, where they gave \"lineage I\" the name \"Pelodiscus jiangxiensis\". As of October 2022, the paper is only accessible as a preprint and thus doesn't have any nomenclatural value according to the ICZN rules. The description of \"Pelodiscus shipian\", on the other hand, was published already in April 2022. \n\n## Phylogeny\n\n Based on phylogenetic analyses, \"Pelodiscus shipian\" is the sister species of \"Pelodiscus huangshanensis\", with the second closest relative being \"Pelodiscus axenaria\". These three species constitute the \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" complex, which forms a clade sister to all other \"Pelodiscus\" species. \n\n## Description\n\n \"Pelodiscus shipian\" is a small species, with an adult carapace length of . \"Pelodiscus shipian\" can be confused with the other species of the \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" complex, especially with \"Pelodiscus axenaria\". The carapace color of \"Pelodiscus shipian\" is typically olive clay with greenish-black marbling. The carapace is distinctly keeled, and the entoplastron is boomerang-shaped. The plastron is yellowish-white and has no markings except for the dark patches near the armpits. \n\n## Distribution and habitat\n\n Like all species of the \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" complex, \"Pelodiscus shipian\" is endemic to China. The type locality is in Fengxin County, Jiangxi Province. Other genetically verified records exist from the neighboring Hunan Province. However, the exact distribution range of the species is still unknown. Both \"Pelodiscus shipian\" and \"Pelodiscus axenaria\" are confirmed to be present in Hunan, and they may be sympatric. \"Pelodiscus shipian\" has a strict habitat preference. It only lives in parts of rivers that have sandy bottoms and clear water that is rich in oxygen. It's also highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance. \n\n## Threats\n\n Within its native range, \"Pelodiscus shipian\" is highly valued as human food. Hunting is not restricted or regulated, and the species is widely hunted by local villagers. The species is more restricted in its habitat preference than the much more common \"Pelodiscus sinensis\", making \"Pelodiscus shipian\" vulnerable to overhunting.", "Christopher Wolfe": "Christopher Wolfe (born 1949) is an American political scientist and Distinguished Research Scholar and former Affiliate Professor of Politics at the University of Dallas.

Started as a weekly magazine in 1824 by Egerton Brydges and his son using the pseudonym Tobias Merton, it went through a number of editors, becoming a monthly magazine towards the end of 1824, was bought by Alaric Alexander Watts in late 1825, and ended under William Charlton Wright in 1828. Its primary emphasis shifted from prose to poetry under Watts, who managed to get contributions from several notable poets of the day. \n\n## History\n\n \"The Literary Magnet\" was started as a weekly magazine in 1824 with the full title \"The Literary Magnet of the Belles Lettres, Science, and the Fine Arts\", by co-editors Samuel Egerton Brydges and his son Egerton Anthony Brydges under the joint pseudonym Tobias Merton (perhaps an anagram of their names). Its first series was published by William Charlton Wright, and ran until June 1824. Egerton Anthony Brydges seems to have stopped editing the magazine near the start of volume two, with no evidence of any contributions from him after the second issue, and his father's contributions seem only to have continued until the eighth issue. An unknown editor using the initials \"J. H. H.\" effectively took over from issue nine. Towards the end of the second series, after the fiftieth sixteen-page weekly issue of the magazine, it was turned into a monthly magazine. The third volume, published 1825, changed publishers to George Wightman, and started to include colour plates. Part way through this volume, the magazine was divided into two parts: \"The Literary Magnet\" and \"The Monthly Journal\". A fourth volume, dated 1825, completed the magazine's first series. The editorship changed at least once more to another unknown figure before the end of the first series, though the pen-name Tobias Merton was kept throughout this series as the nominal editor, and as a character in its \"Round Table\" columns. Alaric Alexander Watts bought \"The Literary Magnet\" by December 1825, and made an unnamed \"very clever young literary friend\" the editor of the first volume of its second series, which ran from January to June 1826. This was published by Charles Knight, with the full title changed to \"The Literary Magnet, or Monthly Journal of the Belles Lettres\". Watts became the anonymous editor for volumes two (July to December 1826), three (January to June 1827), and four (July to December 1827). A final fifth volume was published and edited by the original publisher William Charlton Wright under the title \"Wright's Literary Magnet\". It consisted of just three monthly issues (January to March 1828), which were described by Professor Ted Ellis as \"poorly written\". \n\n## Content\n\n \"The Literary Magnet\"s first series title page set out its aims, to publish \"1. original satirical essays of permanent interest; 2. sketches of society, humourous and sentimental; 3. original poetry; 4. miscellaneous matters; forming a body of original and elegant literature\", with the first issue describing a focus on \"essays, fictions, sketches of character\" and book reviews \"with copious extracts\". Its essays, sketches, poetry and engravings were often comic. Under \"J. H. H.\", a humorous \"Round Table\" column was introduced, purporting to be a record of meetings of the magazine's inner circle, modeled after \"Blackwood's Magazine\"s \"\". This continued occasionally in volumes two and three of the first series. While the first series gave priority to prose, the second series concentrated much more on poetry. The first four volumes of the second series added a \"Chit-Chat\" column, which may have contributed to Watts' reputation as a gossip. Among its contributors were Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Arthur Ashpitel, and Edward George Ballard. For the first four volumes of the second series (1826\u20131827), Watts managed to get contributions from a number of poets at the height of their popularity, including John Clare, Mary and William Howitt, Thomas Hood, Felicia Hemans, Mary Russell Mitford, William Lisle Bowles, Maria Jane Jewsbury, Derwent Conway, Margaret Hodson, Jeremiah Holmes Wiffen, Margaret Cornwell Baron Wilson, and Cornelius Webbe.

He was the youngest of ten children. \n\n## Career\n\n He migrated to Costa Rica in 1890 at age 13 to join his older brothers in business. The brothers had arrived in 1885 to work for Minor Cooper Keith, who was building a railroad from Limon to San Jose, but quickly went into business as merchants, bankers and banana planters. In 1907, the brothers purchased Juan Vi\u00f1as, a vast sugar and coffee farm from Federico Tinoco Granados. They became largest coffee and sugar producers in the Costa Rica. In 1908, the brothers founded the Florida Ice and Farm Company in Siquirres, Lim\u00f3n Province. The company was located at a farm called La Florida and was a major producer of ice and other agricultural produce.

On October 27, 1911, Cecil Lindo gave the Atlantic Fruit Company an option to purchase their banana plantations for $3,500,000 before August, 1912. Cecil was to be the General Manager of the Atlantic Fruit Company in Costa Rica. The Atlantic Fruit Company could not or would not execute the option, and in 1912, the Lindo properties were sold to United Fruit Company for $5,000,000. By 1913, the Lindo brothers were owners of vast sugar, coffee and cocoa estates, lumber and flour mills, breweries, ice-making and aerated factories. Their agricultural interests included 1,000 acres of sugar, 2,000 acres of cacao and 7,000 acres of Coffee plantations, exporting three millions pounds of coffee each year, with an approximate value of half a million dollars.  \n\n## Jamaica\n\n By 1911, Percy owned several thousand acres of land in the Oracabessa area. That year he sold a property to Ruth Bryan Owen, which she named Golden Clouds.  In 1914, Lindo Bros. &amp; Co. Ltd. was formed in Jamaica and Percy was appointed the resident manager.  The company began by purchasing properties along north coast of the island to plant bananas in conjunction with their cousins, the deLisser Brothers. In 1916 they purchased the entire estate of Colonel Charles Ward, which included J. Wray and Nephew Ltd. and large estates in Saint Catherine and Clarendon.  The next year Appleton Estate in Saint Elizabeth and Cornwall in Westmoreland were purchased by the company.  They expanded factory and distillery operations, adding additional warehouses to store and age the rums, a bottle washing machine and an electric bottling line.

It brings together recordings that were initially issued on the small, obscure Pipe label, founded by Koglmann in 1973, and having a total of three releases in its catalog. Four of the album's tracks were recorded in Vienna in 1973, and originally appeared on the 1973 LP \"Flaps\", credited to Koglmann and Lacy. The remaining tracks, recorded in Paris and Vienna during 1975 and 1976, are from the 1977 LP \"Opium for Franz\", credited to Koglmann and Dixon. \"Opium\" was released in 2001 by the German label Between the Lines, and was remastered from copies of the two LPs, as the original tapes had been lost. According to Koglmann, the \"Flaps\" album came about after he heard Lacy live in Paris in 1971 and invited the saxophonist to join him on his first record. He recalled: \"I loved his introspection... I thought: 'Here's the Chet Baker of free jazz!'\" Following the release of \"Flaps\", Koglmann sent a copy to Dixon, who was impressed, and agreed to record with him, resulting in \"Opium for Franz\". In 2019, \"Flaps\" and \"Opium for Franz\" were reissued by the Black Monk label. \n\n## Reception\n\n In a review for AllMusic, Steve Loewy wrote: \"Each track is filled with treasures. The rare opportunity to hear Lacy and Koglmann together is an absolute treat, fulfilling expectations, while the unusual pairing of Dixon and Koglmann on trumpet... is also a treasure.\" The authors of \"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings\" called Dixon's \"For Franz\" \"a significant statement.\" Dan Warburton of \"Paris Transatlantic\" commented: \"Koglmann's alert and responsive playing... still sounds remarkably fresh... Geier's electronics... sound delightfully wacky... Silva's bass work... is mind-blowing, and the contributions of Dixon himself and frequent collaborator Steve Horenstein on tenor are as fresh and challenging today as they were a quartet of a century ago.\" Writing for \"JazzWord\", Ken Waxman commented: \"If you're looking for a new look at Koglmann \u2014 and unjustly 'lost' excellent work from two American masters \u2014 head out to find \"Opium\". It will only be addictive in that it will encourage you to find other sessions by these artists.\" In an article for \"La Folia\", Steve Koenig remarked: \"The formidable Koglmann... goes horn to horn with trumpeter Bill Dixon on Dixon's long track... As the tapes were missing, these are from some worn but not scratched LPs. With music this tight, I wouldn't care if the provenance were wartime shellacs.\" Regarding Dixon's \"For Franz,\" Mark Corroto of \"All About Jazz\" wrote: \"As with much of Dixon's and Koglmann's music, the mode is cinematic. Dixon arranges the parts to mix melody with meditations, solos vault into the composition and recede.

The addition of wings results in cornering speeds that are faster than that which is achieved by the wingless Formula Ford cars and comparable to Formula Renault, and provides drivers with valuable first-time experience of the unique characteristics of aerodynamic downforce. Formula BMW was strictly a \"control\" formula. This term describes a formula in which every major aspect of equipment and suppliers is restricted. Control formulae normally have only one chassis specification, one engine, and single suppliers of tires and fuel. Modifications to the chassis, bodywork and engine are not permitted and this is strictly enforced through scrutineering. In the case of Formula BMW, tuning is restricted to basic adjustment of the gear ratios, suspension, brake balance, and wing angles. The engines are sealed to prevent illegal modifications and are serviced by Schnitzer Motorsport. DesignworksUSA, a subsidiary of BMW, led the design of the car in cooperation with the French chassis constructor Mygale, which was responsible for production. The result, designated \"FB02\", was a compact design, with a carbon-fibre composite tub constructed to the safety standards of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (motorsport's world governing body).

He is considered a pioneer of alternative manga through his incorporation of cinematic techniques into manga from the mid-1950s onward. His style known as \"komaga\", together with the manga of Yoshihiro Tatsumi and Takao Saito, was the catalyst of the \"gekiga\" movement. \n\n## Life\n\n \n\n## Childhood and career start\n\n Matsumoto was born in 1934 in Osaka, Japan. Growing up, his father, who died in 1943, forbid him to read manga. In 1945, during the end of World War II, his family fled to Kobe. After the war, he subscribed to the magazine \"Sh\u014dnen Club\" and was interested in its illustrations, prose, and science sections. He began drawing during middle school and won a prize for an oil painting in 1949. During this time, he also gained an interest in manga by discovering the works of Osamu Tezuka. He rented titles such as \"Nextworld\" from rental libraries. In 1951, Matsumoto visited Tezuka at his home in Takarazuka to get his autograph. Afterwards, he decided to become a manga artist himself. The first work he drew was the Tezuka-inspired science fiction manga \"Chiky\u016b no Saigo\" (\"When Worlds Collide\") in 1952. While several publishers rejected this manga, the rental library publisher T\u014dy\u014d Shuppansha proposed for him to draw another work, as they saw that science fiction manga were not selling as well anymore. This led to Matsumoto's debut work as a manga artist, the schoolhouse comedy \"Botchan Sensei\", which was published in October 1953. \n\n## \"Komaga\" and \"gekiga\"\n\n After creating several more comedies, he published his first non-humoristic work in March 1954, \"Botchan Tantei\" (\"Kid Detective\"), with publisher Hinomaru Bunko. He drew both full-length books as well as short stories for Hinomaru Bunko's mystery anthology \"Kage\" (\"Shadow\") from its first issue in March 1956. \"Kage\" is considered the first mystery manga magazine in the rental library market. His work became a catalyst for the manga movement \"komaga\" (\"panel pictures\") due to its innovation in importing visual motifs from cinema. The term \"komaga\" was conceptualized as a new form of comic in opposition to the term \"manga\" and started appearing on the covers of Matsumoto's books and short stories from 1956 on. \"Komaga\" is considered a precursor to the term \"gekiga\" (\"dramatic pictures\"), which fellow Hinomaru artist Yoshihiro Tatsumi created a year later. For one month in the summer of 1956, Hinomaru Bunko arranged for Matsumoto, Tatsumi and Takao Saito, to live together in Osaka in order to increase their productivity, and this became a space of artistic exchange between the artists. At the same time as other manga artists publishing at Hinomaru Bunko, Matsumoto moved to Tokyo in 1957. With Saito, Tatsumi, and five others, he founded the atelier Gekiga K\u014db\u014d in 1959. They started publishing the magazine \"Matenr\u014d\" as a creative platform for the movement. Until 1962, he produced thousands of pages of \"gekiga\". The atelier was short-lived; it disbanded in 1960 over internal divisions, but was important for the development of \"gekiga\". \n\n## Late career\n\n In the mid-1960s, he slowed down his pace and shifted his career to \"seinen\" manga, publishing gag manga like \"Panda Love\" (1973) and more personal works. His last published manga was the autobiographical manga \"Gekiga Bakatachi!!\", serialized in Shogakukan's magazine \"Big Comic\" in 1979, which recounts his experience of creating the foundations for the \"gekiga\" movement together with Tatsumi and Saito in Osaka in the 1950s. From 1980 on, he focused his artistic career on papercutting. He died of cancer in 2005. \n\n## Style\n\n Matsumoto was strongly influenced by Tezuka at the beginning of his career, especially Tezuka's focus on story rather than humor. Unlike Tezuka, Matsumoto drew more elongated characters and made his stories consistently dramatic without comic elements, which Tezuka had included in all of his works. Matsumoto developed the term \"komaga\" (\"panel pictures\") to describe his style in opposition to mainstream manga ( \"whimsical pictures\"). Matsumoto imported visual motifs from cinema, especially film noir, and drew inspiration from crime literature by Edogawa Ranpo, Seishi Yokomizo, and the \"Tarao Bannai\" series for his detective and mystery manga. He used low-angle shots, metered breakdown, metered montage, and chronoscopia (\"time-watching\") in order to provide a film-like experience. Manga scholar Mitsuhiro Asakawa points out the frequency of scenes showing train crossings in his early \"komaga\" that are meant to evoke an \"excited feeling\". Shea Hennum says his later style in works like \"Cigarette Girl\" is characterized by short-limbed characters with abstract faces resembling caricatures, as well as urban background drawings. \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote: \"He tells stories without complicated dialogue, often getting everything out of a panel through something as simple as emotive, onomatopoeic sound effects.\"  \n\n## Legacy\n\n Manga scholar Ryan Holmberg credits Matsumoto as one of the pioneers of alternative manga through the development of \"komaga\", but also says that it is a lesser-known term than Tatsumi's \"gekiga\". Matsumoto was one of the first to use a consistent dramatic, rather than comic, story mode in his manga. Tatsumi was influenced by Matsumoto and they are considered to have been friendly rivals. Sh\u014dichi Sakurai, Tatsumi's brother and manga critic, called Matsumoto \"the true innovator of \"gekiga\" and today's manga\" in an article for \"Garo\" in the early 1970s. Tatsumi published the autobiographical manga \"A Drifting Life\" from 1995 until 2004 recounting his manga career and the emergence of \"gekiga\", also as a response to Matsumoto's \"Gekiga Bakatachi!!\". From the beginning of the 2000s on, Matsumoto's work gained a new appreciation and was re-edited in Japan by publishers Shogakukan (\"The Man Next Door\") and Seirinkogeisha (\"Panda Love\", \"Cigarette Girl\", \"Gekiga Bakatachi!!\"). The 2009 Shogakukan reprint of \"The Man Next Door\" published interviews with Matsumoto as well as testimonies by artists Yoshihiro Tatsumi, Takao Saito, Hayao Miyazaki, Shinji Mizushima, Shigeru Mizuki, Ryoichi Ikegami, Kazuo Umezu, Yoshiharu Tsuge, Noboru Kawasaki and Tatsuhiko Yamagami. In 2003, a gallery in Ginza created a solo exhibition of Matsumoto's work. Several galleries made solo exhibitions of his papercutting work. In the 2010s, he also gained international recognition: his work was featured in the exhibition \"Gekiga: Alternative Manga from Japan\" at The Cartoon Museum in London in 2014. His work was translated into English, French and Spanish. \"Cigarette Girl\" was nominated for the Prize for Inheritance at the 2011 Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival.", "A Cut Above (TV series)": "A Cut Above is a Canadian reality competition television series, which premiered in 2022 on Discovery Channel Canada.

Thus, for example, if a longitudinal wave from a fluid (e.g., water or air) strikes a solid (e.g., steel plate), it is usually refracted and reflected as a function of the angle of incidence, but if some of the energy causes particle movement in the transverse direction, a second transverse wave is generated, which can also be refracted and reflected. Snellius' law of refraction can be formulated as: formula_1 This means that the incident wave is split into two different wave types at the interface. If we consider a wave incident on an interface of two different solids (e.g. aluminum and steel), the wave type of the reflected wave also splits. Besides these simple mode conversions, an incident wave can also be converted into surface waves. For example, if one radiates a longitudinal wave at a shallower angle than that of total reflection onto a boundary surface, it will be totally reflected, but in addition a surface wave traveling along the boundary layer will be generated. The incident wave is thus converted into reflected longitudinal and surface wave. In general, mode conversions are not discrete processes, i.e. a part of the incident energy is converted into different types of waves. The amplitudes (transmission factor, reflection factor) of the converted waves depend on the angle of incidence. \n\n## Seismic waves\n\n In seismology, a wave conversion specifically refers to the conversion between P and S waves at discontinuities. Body waves are reflected and refracted when they hit a boundary layer within the earth. Here, P-waves can be converted into S-waves (PS-wave) at interfaces, as well as vice versa (SP-wave). Here applies analogously for an incident P-wave: formula_2 The change in amplitudes can be described with the zoeppritz equations.", "Toni Estes": "Toni Estes is an American singer-songwriter and background vocalist best known for co-writing Whitney Houston's 1999 hit single \"It's Not Right but It's Okay\", as well as her other work with producer Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins.

His account of the movement's history, published in 1924, provided a key primary source for historiography about the movement. \n\n## Biography\n\n In April 1920, a Nabat meeting in Kharkiv resolved to renew their participation in the Makhnovist movement and dispatched a three-man delegation to the insurgent command. Teper, along with Aron Baron and Yakiv Sukhovolski, linked up with the insurgent command. But they quickly came into conflict with the military leadership, with one case of an argument between Teper and Dmitry Popov ending with Popov threatening to have Teper killed.  In August 1920, Nestor Makhno met with Teper and tasked him with securing an agreement with the Ukrainian Soviet government against the Army of Wrangel. The next month, he attended a Nabat conference in Kharkiv, where Baron passed an anti-Makhnovist resolution. Nevertheless, by October 1920, the Starobilsk agreement between the Makhnovists and the Bolsheviks was ratified, securng the release of Nabat members from prison. During the brief period of armistice between the two factions, Teper oversaw the publication of \"The Makhnovist Voice\" () in Kharkiv. Dmitry Popov, an opponent of the agreement with the Bolsheviks, published a series of anti-Bolshevik articles in the paper. According to Teper, Popov was a staunch anti-communist and had set himself the goal of killing 300 communists, but only managed to kill 200 before his own death. On 26 November 1920, the leadership of the Nabat was arrested in Kharkiv. Teper was captured by the Cheka and wrote a book about his experiences in prison, likely supervised by the Cheka. In his book, Teper rejected allegations that Nestor Makhno was a Ukrainian nationalist and an antisemite, largely attributing cases of antisemitism within the Insurgent Army to units with criminal or nationalist inclinations. He also detailed a case when Makhno insisted that an insurgent, charged with having raped a woman, be shot. But the tribunal narrowly voted to relieve him from command and place him on the front, where he died shortly thereafter. His criticisms for the movement were largely reserved for his own former organisation - the Nabat - which he claimed to be the real director of the Makhnovshchina, even depicting Aron Baron as the movement's dictator. In historiography, the book has been valued for its reprinting of the Starobilsk agreement. Teper's account was later criticised in Soviet historiography, with Teper being accused of attempting to rehabilitate Makhno.", "N\u00e9 Lopes": "Manuel Alberto \"N\u00e9\" Cunha Lopes (born 29 May 2000) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Gil Vicente. \n\n## Career\n\n Lopes is a youth product of Braga and Gil Vicente.

Its namesake was Malcolm X. \n\n## History\n\n People who were a part of the group Parent Support Network argued that the Lansing School District facilities had not adequately served black children, and they used that as the reason to create the Shabazz School. Additionally, the small charter schools attracted parents who wanted more of a say in their child's school. Shabazz was established in 1995. It initially was in an ex-ice cream shop, and later it occupied what was previously Pleasant Grove Elementary School. Its initial enrollment was 150, and that was below the number of students who had applied to attend the school. Central Michigan University was the authorizer of the school's charter. In 2019 the university stated that the school was in the lowest 5% performance bracket in the state and that the university would not continue to authorize the school. The school closed that year. In 2020 a court forced the board of education of the school to begin the process of selling the building. \n\n## Curriculum\n\n The school used an Afrocentric curriculum. \n\n## Operations\n\n The school used a traditional style of school uniform.

This appears to be due to the steric hindrance of the fluorine atoms around the xenon atom. However, scientists try to prepare it. \n\n## Potential synthesis\n\n The formation of xenon octafluoride has been calculated to be endothermic:", "Bruce Morton (mathematician)": "Bruce Morton (11 April 1926 \u2013 15 September 2012) was an Australian/New Zealand applied mathematician.  \n\n## Early life and education\n\n Morton was born in Wellington, New Zealand and educated at Auckland Grammar School. He gained a government scholarship to attend the University of Auckland, where he completed a double degree in mathematics and physics. Whilst at the University of Auckland he was an active member of the mountaineering club and climbed with Edmund Hillary. In 1949, Morton was awarded the Rutherford fellowship to study for a BA mathematical tripos at St John's College, Cambridge. \n\n## Cambridge\n\n In 1956 he completed his PhD in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMPT) at Cambridge University under the supervision of Sir G.I. Taylor and Sir George Batchelor. His thesis work was published in paper that became a classic of the fluid dynamics literature - the much cited Morton, Taylor and Turner result. The study developed an explanation for a source of buoyancy being injected into a stratified fluid. By conserving volume, momentum and buoyancy, the study predicted the final height to which a plume of light fluid will rise in a stably stratified fluid. These predictions where then compared with laboratory experiments created using a stratified salt solution. Fellow student and co-author on the plume paper Stewart Turner recalled that Batchelor suggested that he conduct some laboratory experiments to test Morton's theory of the rise of plumes and \u201cbuoyant clouds\u201d in stratified surroundings. The starting point was an entrainment hypothesis proposed by Taylor which assumes that the rising turbulent motion in the plume causes an inflow of environmental fluid at a rate that is proportional to the average upward velocity. When Morton and Turner wrote the manuscript documenting the agreement between theory and experiment they discovered that Taylor was also preparing a \u201cmuch delayed note\u201d on the subject. Taylor included an explanation at the end of the Morton paper explaining the circumstances. He did add some distinctive touches to the article including estimates of the height of rise of smoke from an autumn bonfire (150 ft) and a burning town (3200 m) with specified burning rates and atmospheric conditions; and as noted by Turner - the mixed units are Taylor's.   \n\n## University of Manchester\n\n After his Ph.D. Morton briefly took up an academic appointment at University College London. However, he was soon offered a position at the University of Manchester by James Lighthill where he worked until 1967. During this time he developed an interest in the propagation of bush fires.  \n\n## Monash University\n\n In 1967, Morton was appointed to a chair in applied mathematics at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. There he established a leading research group in geophysical fluid dynamics within the department of mathematics. As well as his influential work on plumes he emphasized the importance of vorticity in the behaviour of fluids. In lectures he would often state \u2018vorticity is the flow field\u2019. He retired as chair in 1991. After his death in 2012 a special issue of the journal Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Journal (which changed its name to Journal of Southern Hemisphere Earth Systems Science in 2016) dedicated to Morton's work and impact was published in 2014. It contained a series of invited review papers by prominent research scientists from around the world who interacted with Morton on the many topics he was involved in throughout his career. As well as plumes, he worked on tropical cyclone formation, as recognised in the special issue. \n\n## AMOS and the Morton Medal\n\n Morton contributed to the running and organisation of the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society, especially in the fostering of participation from all parts of Australia. In 2000 the Society renamed its AMOS Medal after him and commenced awarding the Morton Medal as a \"biennial award recognising leadership in meteorology and/or oceanography and/or related fields, with particular emphasis on education and development of young scientists, and personal example in research\". Winners of the medal include Matthias Tomczak, Gary Meyers, Andy Pitman, Ann Henderson-Sellers, David Karoly, John Church, and Matthew England.  \n\n## Personal Life\n\n In 1953 Morton married Alison Gladding, who he had met in the University of Auckland mountaineering club, at the Marylebone Presbyterian Church near Marble Arch in London.

It sits in the Big Muddy Valley, which was formed over 12,000 years ago near the end of the last ice age when a glacial lake outburst flood occurred from a pre-historic glacial lake located at present-day Old Wives Lake. In the summer, extensive mudflats develop at the east and west ends of the lake providing habitat for a variety of species, including the piping plover. \n\n## Important Bird Area\n\n The entirety of Willow Bunch Lake is part of the Willow Bunch Lake (SK 020) Important Bird Area (IBA) of Canada. The IBA, which totals , is important to the piping plover as it has one of the three largest breeding concentrations on the Canadian Prairies. The other two areas are Chaplin Lake (SK 033) and Quill Lakes SK 002. The provincial Wildlife Habitat Protection Act designated the entire Willow Bunch Lake basin as a critical piping plover habitat and the lake's shoreline up to the high water mark is protected from development. The population and breeding success of the piping plover depends largely on lake water levels.

He was a part of the student body during his time in ATPU. \n\n## Career\n\n After graduating, Munandar became a civil servant within the Ministry of Public Works' planning department, initially as a supervisor. He worked within the Jatiluhur Dam project authority, and then managed several projects in Karawang and Bekasi. While a civil servant, he obtained his bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the Bandung Institute of Technology in 1981. By 1987, he was granted a scholarship to study for a master's degree in water management in Chennai, India. He opted to move to Serang in 1999 and began participating in politics, being elected as the deputy mayor of Cilegon. He also joined the United Development Party and was appointed as the party's provincial chair.

His father was a warehouseman in London. He received a private education and trained as a builder. He arrived in Lyttelton on the \"Egmont\" on 23 December 1856, the same ship that brought out Bishop Harper and his family. After travelling through Canterbury and Otago, he settled in Akaroa. \n\n## Professional life and community engagement\n\n In Akaroa, Penlington had a sawmill and he was a builder. His notable buildings include the court house, the Oddfellows' Hall, the parsonage of and the transepts for St Peter's Church, the hospital and the school. Penlington was a member of many organisations. He was active in the Anglican church and was churchwarden for many years. He was elected onto the Akaroa School Committee in February 1867 and was at times the chairman. He was a member of the Hospital Board. He belonged to the Town Hall and the Horticultural committees. He was patron for the Akaroa Boating Club. When the provincial system was disestablished and replaced with borough councils in late 1876, he became one of the Akaroa Borough's first councillors. Apart from one interval, he remained on the borough council for the rest of his life. At the time, local election were held annually towards the end of the year for the next calendar year. Nominations for the mayoralty were due on 19 November 1888 but no-one came forward. And new call for nominations was put out for 28 November 1888 and Penlington was the only candidate; he was thus declared elected unopposed. He was installed as mayor on 19 December 1888. A year later, Penlington was challenged by councillor Lionel Corbett, but the votes were 63 to 19 in the incumbent's favour. In November 1890, Penlington was once again declared elected unopposed. In November 1891, Penlington did not stand again for the mayoralty. He installed his successor, the solicitor Herbert Clarke, on 16 December 1891. \n\n## Family\n\n Penlington married Maria Felgate at St Peter's Church on 19 November 1858.

It depicts the Wiesen Viaduct, south of Davos, in Switzerland. It is signed on the bottom right of the center and is dated '26' on the back. The painting is held at the Kirchner Museum Davos. \n\n## History and description\n\n In the years 1925/1926, a stylistic change started to appear in Kirchner's work. In his depictions of people he tried more abstract approaches, while in his landscapes he pursued a precise representationalism without formal experiments such as the distortions painted earlier. It is not known for how long Kirchner worked on this painting and when he began the preparatory work. However, a draft sketch of the painting, which Kirchner made as earlier as 1924, has survived. This preparatory drawing was donated to the Kirchner Museum Davos from a private collection in Hamburg. The center of the painting depicts the railway viaduct of the Rhaetian Railway over the Landwasser river near Davos-Wiesen, a well-known structure of Alpine railway architecture. The structure had been completed in 1909, so it was still quite new when the painting was made. Kirchner depicts a view of the viaduct as seen from the south. Compared to Kirchner's earlier depictions of buildings and structures, which often showed distorted proportions and perspectives, this image is closer to reality. In his depiction, Kirchner pays attention to the lines of the bridge and precisely reproduces the parabolic construction of the main arch and the semicircular formation of the smaller arches. The colors of the picture do not correspond to reality, but to Kirchner's artistic conception. A red and white railway signal can be seen above the bridge on the left side of the painting, a so-called Hippsche turning disc. The signal was left as a memorial where its shown here, even after it was decommissioned in 1987, perhaps because Kirchner had immortalized it in this painting. While Kirchner, who had also a degree in architecture, initially focused on the landscape and its components, over the years the architecture there increasingly became part of the content of the painting, from which the current work is a typical example. \n\n## Provenance\n\n In 1933, at the instigation of the art-loving Landammann Erhard Branger, the municipality of Davos acquired the painting \"Rathaus Davos Platz\", directly from Kirchner, after lengthy purchase negotiations, and despite some resistance from the population. The artist not only gave the community a considerable discount on the originally estimated purchase price, but also offered it the current painting. \"The Bridge at Wiesen\" hung with two other paintings by Kirchner at Branger's office in Davos town hall, since the Summer of until he left office in 1936. The whereabouts of the painting in the following decades are unclear. In the 1960s it was open to public view and housed unprotected in the premises of the Davos Tourist Office. Since the late 1960s the painting was exhibited in numerous art museums in European cities and in the United States. The insurance value of the painting increased steadily over time.

He was consecrated in 2013 as bishop suffragan in the Atlantic coast network of PEARUSA, which in 2016 became the Anglican Diocese of Christ Our Hope. Since 1989, he has been rector of the Church of the Holy Spirit in Roanoke County, Virginia. \n\n## Early life and education\n\n Lawrence was raised in Richmond, Virginia, the oldest of three children. His father, R. Quigg Lawrence Sr., was a Navy veteran and marketer who worked on the creative team that developed the Virginia Is for Lovers campaign. The elder Lawrence was also a recording studio executive who employed a young Bruce Springsteen, and music promoter, and his son worked as security for acts like David Bowie. Lawrence attended Collegiate School in Richmond, graduating in 1977. He spent two years at the University of Virginia, where he said he majored in \"fraternity mayhem.\" His ambitions to become a doctor frustrated by his alcohol abuse and womanizing, he left UVA and spent 1979 and 1980 working as an EMT and paramedic in Richmond and at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. He came to Christian faith after a fellow surfer gave him a copy of John Stott's \"Basic Christianity\". Lawrence has said that he received his call to ministry while working as a paramedic: Lawrence finished his undergraduate degree in emergency medicine at Central Washington University, then enrolled in Virginia Theological Seminary, where he earned his M.Div. Lawrence also met Annette Fleet after completing seminary, and they married in 1986. They have three adult children and seven grandchildren. Lawrence later received a doctorate from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. \n\n## Ordained ministry\n\n After graduation, Lawrence was appointed as an associate pastor in Kilmarnock, Virginia. He was released from the job in 1988. In January 1989, he was named the first rector of the Church of the Holy Spirit (CHS), a church plant that had grown out of the Cursillo movement and had just been elevated from mission to parish status in the Episcopal Diocese of Southwestern Virginia. The theologically conservative Lawrence frequently fought with liberalizing elements in the Episcopal Church. \u201cAlmost everything was a hill I would die on,\" Lawrence has said. CHS grew from 45 members to more than 1,400 and spawned multiple church plants in the Roanoke area. In 1995, an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit called the Terumah Foundation raised funds to purchase land and construct a 27,000-square-foot facility on Merriman Road in southwest Roanoke County. While CHS used the property, Terumah remained the owner. In 2000, early in the process of the Anglican realignment, Bishop Neff Powell deposed Lawrence and ejected CHS from the Diocese of Southwestern Virginia. The arrangement with Terumah allowed CHS to leave the Episcopal Church without forfeiting the property it used to the diocese. CHS became one of the first U.S. churches to join the Anglican Mission in America, and Lawrence's orders were recognized by the Anglican Church of Rwanda. \n\n## Episcopal ministry\n\n Lawrence and CHS joined PEARUSA after its separation from AMIA in order to remain connected with the Anglican Church of Rwanda and the Anglican Church in North America. Lawrence was elected suffragan bishop for PEARUSA's Atlantic coast network, where he would assist Steve Breedlove with care for clergy in the region. He remained rector of CHS. The Most Rev. Onesphore Rwaje and the Most Rev. Robert Duncan consecrated Lawrence as a bishop on February 4, 2013, at CHS. In 2016, Lawrence and CHS transitioned from PEARUSA to the newly constituted Anglican Diocese of Christ Our Hope, ending the dual canonical residency in the ACNA and Rwanda. After Todd Atkinson took a leave of absence and was later inhibited over charges of abuse of spiritual authority, Lawrence was in October 2021 appointed interim bishop for Via Apostolica. He remained bishop suffragan in the Diocese of Christ Our Hope and rector at CHS.

In 1610, she married Robert Wright, and they later emigrated to the Colony of Virginia, originally living in Elizabeth City. They had two sons, William and Robert. She was a self-professed healer and described as a \"cunning\" woman, the term used for those who practiced \"low-level\" or \"folk\" magic. She was also left-handed, which deemed her untrustworthy and suspicious by the day's standards. Wright lived and worked as a midwife in Surry County and was referred to as \"Goodwife Wright\". \n\n## Witch trial\n\n In 1626, the Allington family refused to have Wright as their midwife because she was left-handed. The mother fell ill with a breast infection and the newborn baby died shortly after it was born. Quickly, the family and neighbors began to accuse Wright of the infant's demise.  On September 11, 1626, Wright was called before the General Court of Virginia in Jamestown, Virginia on the charge of witchcraft. The presiding judge of her hearing was Sir George Yeardley, the Colonial Governor of Virginia. The formal accusation and investigatory hearing of Wright is the earliest witchcraft allegation on record against an English settler in any British North American colony.  The court heard extensive testimony during the inquiry. Her accusers claimed that she had cursed their local livestock and crops, caused a heavy rainfall, bewitched their butter churns, accurately predicted the deaths of several of her neighbors, and cast a spell that caused the death of a newborn baby. During the inquiry, Wright did nothing to dispute the charges of witchcraft, and, in some instances, subtly encouraged this belief. \n\n## Outcome\n\n It is believed that Wright was acquitted despite her admission that she did possess basic knowledge of witchcraft practices. In her response to her charges, she remarked, \"God forgive them.\" Available court records do not describe how the hearing ended, and there is no surviving record of a sentence. \n\n## Legacy\n\n A Virginia witch trial loosely based on the story of Joan Wright is featured in a 2017 episode of the British drama television series Jamestown. In 2019, an original play, \"Season of the Witch\" premiered at the Jamestown Settlement. The play is a dramatic retelling of the witch trials in Virginia, with a focus on the story of Wright.", "Bruno Saura": "Bruno Saura (born 5 August 1965) is a French anthropologist.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. \n\n## Description\n\n The building is one of only three extant buildings from the era when Pearce was a thriving community between 1900-1920s. Unlike other southwestern states, Arizona contains very few rural vernacular adobe churches. In addition, of the 1,032 adobe buildings on the NRHP, only 15 are churches. The church is constructed of adobe, and covers approximately 1200 square feet in a cruciform plan. There is a cupola-style belfry over the gabled entrance. The interior walls and ceiling are plaster, and it has a tongue and groove hardwood floor. The only portion of the roof which is gabled is that over the entry, while the other three roof sections have hipped roofs, covered with corrugated steel. A non-historic addition was added at some point, 14 foot by 14 foot, inserted in the northwest quadrant of the cuniform. It has a concrete foundation, and walls of cement stucco. \n\n## History\n\n The church was constructed sometime during 1916\u20131917, and is part of the post-territorial adobe revival period. In early 20th century America, there were typically one of three types of churches: Parish, Mission, or Station. Parish churches had a building and a resident priest; Mission churches had a building, but not a resident priest, instead being served by a visiting priest from a nearby parish; while Station churches had neither a resident priest nor a building, instead the visiting priest would hold services in whatever building/space was available. As of 1900, Pearce was a station of Benson. Over the years their status changed to stations of Nogales and Solomonville. After construction of this church, it became a mission of Solomonville, then in 1918 its mission was changed to Tombstone. The church was little used during the 1930s, and little is known of it during the 1940s and 1950s, but by 1961 it was no longer in use. When the town of Sunsites was established nearby in 1961, the area's population began to increase, and by 1963 the church was back in service. It remained in service until 1969 when increasing numbers prompted the construction of St. Jude's, about four miles to the north. The church's bell was transferred to the new structure.

It was founded by Dr. Chester Rowell and operated by his nephew, Chester Harvey Rowell. \n\n## History\n\n \n\n## Beginnings\n\n The newspaper began on Sept. 23, 1876, when Dr. Chester Rowell, a local physician and politician, published 750 copies of the \"Fresno Weekly Republican\". When the weekly paper became a daily morning publication 11 years later, Rowell renamed it The \"Fresno Morning Republican\". Rowell, one of the few Republicans in Fresno at the time, named his newspaper to reflect his political stance. Rowell was inspired by the Massachusetts-based \"Springfield Republican\". He wanted to emulate the way the Springfield Republican served as a venue for analysis and public discussion of political economics in its region. William Glass became the business manager in 1890 and stabilized operations. By syndicating the Associated News service in their paper, they helped rural Fresno County remain connected to the nation and world at large. \n\n## Advocacy and growth\n\n In 1898, the paper had a circulation of less than 3,000 and the operation was worth less than the loans taken out for it. Dr. Rowell offered the managing editor job to his nephew, Chester Harvey Rowell, who at that point in his career had earned a doctoral degree from the University of Michigan, worked as a clerk in the U.S. House of Representatives, traveled to Europe and taught in Kansas, Wisconsin and Illinois. The younger Rowell had limited ties to California but had followed the politics from afar and had acquired hostility towards the Southern Pacific Railroad company. As editor, Rowell oversaw the growth of the paper as a source of local news but he also penned and printed his own editorials. His editorial critiques focused on vice, liquor, crime and crooked politics in Fresno and California in general. He led a drive to clean up Fresno's corruption and encouraged city leaders to write a city charter. The charter became a reality in 1899. Expanding his scope statewide, Rowell formed the Lincoln\u2013Roosevelt League and began a political reform effort, targeting the Southern Pacific Railroad in particular. The paper's political stance was Progressive, which meant that it lent support to politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt, Robert M. La Follette and Hiram Johnson. In 1920, the paper was bought by George A. Osborn and Chase Osborn Jr. of the Fresno Herald, an afternoon daily. The sale price exceeded $1,000,000. From 1922 through 1930, the paper sponsored a countywide tennis tournament. \n\n## Takeover by the Fresno Bee\n\n James McClatchy's Sacramento Bee had been publishing in California since 1857. McClatchy's sons, CK and Valentine Stuart, looked to expand their business and founded the Fresno Bee in 1922. CK's son Carlos McClatchy became the Fresno Bee's first editor. They followed by founding the Modesto Bee in 1924. These newspapers formed the basis of what became the McClatchy Company. In the 1920s, the Fresno Bee competed with the Fresno Morning Republican, although the Bee differentiated itself by distributing in the afternoon as opposed to the morning. In 1932, the Fresno Bee bought out the Morning Republican and took over the subscription lists and merged the newspapers. The Republican printed its last issue on March 21, 1932, after publishing for 56 years. For many years, The Republican's name remained on the Fresno Bee's masthead. The Morning Republican's former offices at the southern corner of the intersection of Tulare Street and Van Ness Avenue were sold to a furniture store in 1935. The building was remodeled and its brick exterior was covered in stucco but sat vacant for many years and was torn down in 2004. Frank A.

Its aim is to combat gender inequality in cinema by exclusively screening films by female creators, being the first such film society in Romania.

Founded in July 2020 in Bucharest, it has since expanded to include screenings in other Romanian cities, roundtable discussions on issues of gender and cinema, art exhibitions, social research and youth programs. \n\n## History\n\n F-Sides was created in Bucharest in 2020 by Alexandra Lulache and Ioana Diaconu as a means to combat the small number of films by female directors, with only 17% of movies shown in Romanian cinemas in 2019 having been directed by a woman. According to Diaconu, the project seeks to \u201d\"bring the female perspective into the spotlight as to be a starting point for debating topics such as sorority, freedom of one\u2019s own body, girls\u2019 education, violence against women, exploring sexuality, motherhood or intergenerational communication\"\u201d. It was the first Romanian film society to focus on female creators. Because it debuted during the Covid-19 pandemic, screenings took place in outdoor venues during the 2020 season, with some screenings moving online. Beginning with its second year, F-Sides began expanding to other cities in Romania, with screenings taking place in Cluj-Napoca, Timi\u0219oara and Sibiu, among others.

While some critics and designers believe the genre of comedic video games suffers from a lack of development, it has been argued that incidental comedy in video games is rather common, often coming in the form of \"ludo-comedic consonance\", an affinity between narrative and gameplay that reinforces comedy in a similar manner to how ludonarrative dissonance is a disconnect between narrative and gameplay. Both comedy and video games have historically had difficulty gaining recognition and status from academic institutions, and have been called trivial by critics. They were later both determined to be worthy of study, as scholars accepted that goal-oriented gameplay was not the sole means to experience a video game. Nevertheless, it remains common for serious games to be thought of as more artistic, while the artistry necessary to create comedy in a video game has been overlooked. \n\n## Definition\n\n Comedy when applied to video games does not always mean a game specifically designed as a comedic experience. It can refer to humorous moments in narrative (such as a witty line of dialog), in gameplay (such as a glitch, explosion, or other event resulting in slapstick humor), or through interacting with the game itself (such as a streamer becoming frustrated at a game). It is often a difficult combined effort between game developers of different disciplines, such as level designers and animators, to make a truly comedic situation. The theory of humor in games can be separated into three main branches - superiority, incongruity, and relief/release. In the first, similar to how Plato associated laughter with hostility towards others, video games are focused on competition and defeating one's opponent. The second revolves around how one's expectation does not match the result. The third focuses on elements of comic relief, such as sidequests that provide a break from the action. Humor is also commonly used to frame sexuality in video games without being accused of pornography, allowing for transgression of boundaries that would otherwise not be possible, although, in more problematic cases, it has been used to justify highly questionable content, such as in the controversial \"Custer's Revenge\" (1982). \n\n## Reception\n\n Stephen Totilo, writing for \"Slate\" in 2004, questioned why video games were not funny, calling them \"humorless\" in comparison to films and television shows. Speculating that this was caused by the difficulty of integrating comedy into gameplay, he noted that, as games moved away from text towards emphasis on graphics and action, the story and dialog was \"pushed aside\". He also speculated that the best solution was to make the player a \"straight man\". In 2011, game designer Tim Schafer claimed that studios self-censored themselves to the point that games were unable to be comedic, out of fear of causing offense. In 2014, Chris Suellentrop of \"The New York Times\" stated his opinion that comedy was one of the least developed genres in video games besides romance, calling the greatest video game comedy up to that point \"Portal 2\" (2011), a game that \"competes with the best comedic work in any medium\". Reviewing the game \"Jazzpunk\" (2014), he stated that it lacked \"an emotional core\", but cited \"\" (2014) as an example of a successful humorous game. In 2020, William Hughes of \"The A.V. Club\" stated that video games were \"still fumbling clumsily\" with comedy, and were in the \"angry teenager punching walls\" stage of their development as an artistic medium. He called funny games \"outliers\" that were largely in the realm of PC gaming, citing the fact that, in most games, a written script is \"considered a late-development afterthought\". Calling comedy in games \"a matter of deliberation and thoughtfulness\", he criticized games that relied on one-liners and offensive jokes as opposed to designing the entire game to support the comedy.", "Cameron Young (disambiguation)": "Cameron Young (born 1997) is an American golfer.

Khaleeq belonged to a family of Urdu poets who specialised in writing elegies or marsiyas. Khaleeq was the son of Meer Hasan, and the father of Meer 'Anees', who is considered to be a virtuoso of the marsiya genre. \n\n## Life and Family\n\n Meer Khaleeq's forebears had come to Delhi from Herat (Present day Afghanistan) during Shah Jahan's reign. They lived in Delhi for four generations, however when the Mughal rule started declining, they migrated to Faizabad in the princely state of Awadh. Khaleeq was born in Faizabad, in 1766 and was educated in Faizabad and Lucknow. Khaleeq started composing poetry at the age of sixteen. Initially, his work was corrected by his father, but when Mus'hafi came to Lucknow, Khaleeq was put under his pupilage as Meer Hasan was busy writing 'Badr e Munir'. It is also claimed that initially Meer Hasan wanted Khaleeq to become Meer Taqi Meer's pupil, but Meer declined saying that he can't even pay attention to his own children's upbringing, then how could he tutor someone else?. Khaleeq's family's language was considered to be a repository of the idioms of Urdu, so much so that Imam Baksh 'Nasikh' would tell his pupils to go to Khaleeq to learn in its pure form from him. Once Mirza Taqi 'Taraqqi' at whose place Khaleeq used to work arranged for a Mushaira. Khwaja Haidar Ali 'Aatish' was invited from Lucknow for the Mushaira. Khaleeq recited his ghazal with the opening verse: \"Rashk e Aaeena Hai Us Rashk e Qamar Ka Pehlu\" \"Saaf Idhar Se Nazar Aata Hai Udhar Ka Pehlu\" The envy of the mirror is the side of that one who is the envy of the moon The aspect of this side can be clearly seen from that side Upon listening to this, Aatish tore his own ghazal saying that when such a person was present, what need was there for himself. \n\n## Rivalry with Meer Zameer\n\n Although there were a few other great elegy composers in Khaleeq's time, the rivalry between Khaleeq and Meer Zameer was the most noteworthy. It was in their era that the marsiya went through quite significant changes. Earlier, each stanza in the marsiya consisted of 4 lines. Mirza Muhammad Rafi 'Sauda' started writing marsiya in the six liner musaddas form, and it was Khaleeq who made this form popular. Zameer, extended the length of the marsiya from 30 to 40 stanzas long to 70 to 100 stanzas. Both poets had their set of supports who would fight among themselves, however Khaleeq and Zameer out of politeness never appeared together in the same gathering.  It has been narrated that once Nawab Sharaf ud Daulah arranged a majlis at his place and invited everyone. He invited both Khaleeq and Zameer to recite marsiyas, however neither one knew that the other had been invited. On the day of the majlis Zameer recited his marsiya first. Upon seeing Khaleeq, he extended the marsiya, leaving all in the audience with tears in their eyes and praise on their lips. Once he got down from the pulpit, Khaleeq was asked to recite. By the time Khaleeq had recited close to twenty stanzas, the listeners were so lost in the recitation that they were not even aware of each other's presence. Khaleeq got down from the pulpit after reciting twenty-five to thirty stanzas. After he had descended from the pulpit, the listeners looked up only to notice that the pulpit was empty. At the end of the majlis, the supporters of each poet went home proud. \n\n## Death and Legacy\n\n Towards the end of his life due to old age, Khaleeq stopped reciting marsiyas. He passed away on 26 May, 1844, at the age of 78. According to his great grandson 'Urooj', he was buried near the river Gomti.The tradition of writing marsiyas continued in his family for five generations after him, for a total of eight generations. The art of writing marsiyas remained in the family for the better part of two and a half centuries. After Khaleeq, his son Meer Anees continued the tradition of writing marsiyas. Anees took the art of marsiya writing to its zenith, and along with Mirza Salamat Ali 'Dabeer' he is considered to be the best poet of the marsiya genre, earning the title 'Shaa'ir e Azam' \n\n## External Links\n\n Meer Khaleeq Profile Marsiya Collection of Meer Khaleeq", "Su Hanchen": "Su Hanchen (; 10941172) was a Chinese painter active in the Song dynasty.

As with the previous instalment, \"The Stalls of Barchester\" (1971), it was adapted and directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark and was first broadcast on BBC 1 at 11pm on Christmas Eve 1972. Running at 50 minutes, the drama was based on \"A Warning to the Curious\", a ghost story by British writer M. R. James, included in his book \"A Warning to the Curious and Other Ghost Stories\" first published in 1925. \n\n## Synopsis\n\n In the 1930s the recently made unemployed Paxton (Peter Vaughan), an amateur archaeologist who has fallen on hard times during the Great Depression, travels to a remote seaside town in Norfolk to search for one of the three lost crowns of East Anglia, which, according to legend, protect the East Anglian coast from invasion. Paxton tracks down the location of the buried crown by discovering that the local Ager family have been the guardians of the crown and its burial site for generations. The last of the family was William Ager (John Kearney), who had died a few years previously. Upon unearthing the crown, Paxton is stalked by its supernatural guardian. Realising the danger he is in, Paxton, with the assistance of his fellow hotel guest Dr Black (Clive Swift), reburies the crown in an attempt to appease the wrathful guardian spirit that watches over it; but the two men greatly underestimate the punishment that awaits those who are curious enough to dig for the crown. \n\n## Adaptation\n\n In adapting the story, Clark changed the protagonist of the original from a young, innocent amateur who discovers the crown by accident to a middle-aged man (Peter Vaughan) who travels to Seaburgh specifically to find the crown. The era is updated to the 1930s, the background of the Depression adding an extra layer to Paxton's search for the treasure. The narrative layering of the original James story is dispensed with and a chronological narrative is used instead. Clark noted in a 2014 interview that he tried to make \"A Warning to the Curious\" as \"essentially, a silent film, with the tension building slowly throughout the visual images\". Clark also included the character of Dr. Black (Clive Swift), who first appeared in \"The Stalls of Barchester\". \n\n## Locations\n\n For \"A Warning to the Curious\", \"Seaburgh\" (a disguised version of Aldeburgh, Suffolk) was filmed on the coast of North Norfolk at Waxham, Holkham Beach and Holkham Wood at Holkham Gap, Happisburgh, Wells-next-the-Sea and on the North Norfolk Railway.

The book covers how the Wake County Public School System program to socioeconomically balance its schools was abolished due to the local political climate. The authors state that the voters in Wake County, North Carolina liked ethnic diversity but disliked year round education and a lack of school choice, and voters opposed those school district rules. \n\n## Background\n\n Prior to writing the book, they conducted a literature review on the topic. The authors did a spring 2011 survey to determine how residents of Wake County felt about the socioeconomic student assignment practices, with 1,706 people surveyed.

The springs have also been referred to as \"Jewel in the Desert\" and Indian Hot Springs at Eden. \n\n## History\n\n The hot springs were used by local Indigenous people before European and American settlers populated the area. During the late 1870s Ben Gardner developed the site into a commercial property. Gardner developed the springs by building soaking pools and a tent encampment that were used by soldiers from nearby Fort Thomas. Starting in 1885, the site became popular due to the recently constructed Gila Valley, Globe and Northern Railway which stopped in nearby Pima, Arizona. John Holladay and his son purchased the site from Gardener in 1888, and renamed the 200-acre property Holladay Hot Springs. The Holladays ran the bathhouse and also sold lime. In May, 1899, the property was sold to John and Andrew Alexander, two brothers who ran the Geronimo-Globe stagecoach and owned a store in Fort Thomas. The Alexander brothers renamed the property Indian Hot Springs, built 60 cottage-tents and a kitchen and dining hall. They advertised the resort for its \"healing waters as a cure for rheumatism\", and it became a popular tourist destination. The Graham Guardian newspaper reported in 1901 that the hot springs held \"curative properties\" that would be \"known all over the civilized world\". A three-story, 30-room hotel was built the Alexanders in 1903 to replace the tents and cabin-tents. In 1905 a swimming pool was constructed at the hot springs; it was the largest in Arizona at the time and measured 255 feet long by 70 feet wide. In 1914, the Arizona Record newspaper out of Globe, Arizona reported that the hot springs resort excelled \"in efficiency [of] any of the foreign spas\". That same year, Burton Frasher, a photographer from California set up a commercial photographic studio at the settlement, and created a series of images of the hot springs as well as many other scenic cultural and geological sites in the Southwest. In September 1916, Henry and Rose Hill purchased the property, and lengthened the hot springs swimming pool by 15 feet, added a diving board and private bathhouses. The Hill's sold the property to Frank Farrell in 1920 who co-owned it with several partners. In 1964, Jerry Hancock purchased the hot springs property; his wife Irene ran the swimming pool. In 1966 the pool was shut down by the Arizona health department due to the fact that the hot spring water was unclorinated and deemed unsafe. During the 1970s and beyond, the hot springs property had a colorful history of various owners over the years that included the Earth First environmental activist group, another group that called themselves Ruckus, and later a group that included Mick Jagger who first visited the resort in 1982 with the Rolling Stones. In 1998, Royce and Regina Richardson, a gun-carrying well-to-do couple from Phoenix took the hot springs property by force, evicting the caretaker Wesley Prophet. The property was owned byt the Indian Springs Ranch Corporation at the time. The Richardsons' intended to use the springs property as a private retreat, and to establish a business venture that included growing medicinal herbs and building a bottling plant. The following year they were charged with forcible entry without written authorization. In February 2002, Earth First held a conference at the site which was crashed in the evening of February 19 by Ruckus, a competing environmental group. A doctor was shot and killed during the skuffle, and the gunman later committed suicide while being pursued by the police. The 49-year old shooter was Jonathan Bailey from England, who shot Dr. James A. Dassault with a .9mm Glock pistol before killing himself with a shotgun. On February 28, 2008, the 105 year old historic hot springs hotel burned, all that was left were a few masonry walls. \n\n## Water profile\n\n The hot springs located at Indian Hot Springs emerge from the ground at an average temperature of 118\u00b0F / 48\u00b0C.

The two ships would make up the \"Seaside\" EVO-class, described as a \"further evolution of the \"Seaside\"-class prototype\" established by \"MSC Seaside\" and \"MSC Seaview.\" The order for the first \"Seaside\" EVO ship replaced an order originally placed for a third \"Seaside\"-class vessel. \"MSC Seascape\" is described to be the largest and most technologically advanced ship ever built in Italy. The \"MSC Seascape's\" naming ceremony was held on 7 December 2022 at the Manhattan Cruise Terminal.

When he met Stan Lewis, who later became the owner of Jewel Records, Lewis noticed his thin physique and quipped that an apt moniker for Wills would be T.V. Slim. In 1957, Slim recorded his humorous tale of a hapless individual, \"Flat Foot Sam\", with his backing group the Heartbreakers, comprising Mighty Joe Young (guitar), Eddie Williams (piano) and Jimmy White (drums). The first version of \"Flat Foot Sam\" was issued by the tiny Shreveport, Louisiana record label, Clif Records, the same year. Regional sales of the disc were impressive and this came to the attention of Checker Records, who were keen to reissue the song to a wider audience. However, the jagged raw first version was snubbed, and Slim was persuaded to re-record the number in New Orleans, under the tutelage of Cosimo Matassa. This time, Robert Parker gave a saxophone solo, Chess A&amp;R man Paul Gayten played the piano, with Charles \"Hungry\" Williams on drums. The release went on to become Slim's biggest seller, when issued on another Chess subsidiary, Argo Records. Oddly, the re-recording was released under his own name, Oscar Wills. This was not the only change. The Clif Records release indicated that the song's writer was Clara Wills (probably Oscar's wife), but the writer's credit on the Argo single were to O. Wills and S. Lewis. Chess Records had the common practice at that time, where a songwriter had to share the publishing with someone in the industry, who would ensure the record gained sufficient promotion; in this case the aforementioned Stan Lewis. Leonard Chess, for some reason, then reissued the original Clif version on Checker, in the same month as the Argo re-recording was released. \"Billboard\", possibly baffled by it all, awarded the original version of \"Flat Foot Sam\" a higher rating (77) than the Argo single (75). There was a further twist in the tale. As Slim had only recorded the one side in New Orleans, the record company needed a track to go on the B-side. This turned out to be an instrumental \"Nervous Boogie\" recorded by Paul Gayten, who had played piano and produced Slim's June session. \"Nervous Boogie\" generated the greater demand, and ended with a peak position of number 68 on the \"Billboard\" pop chart in December 1957. \"Flat Foot Sam\" itself did not chart, despite being a decent seller. Tommy Blake released a competing version of \"Flatfoot Sam\" in September 1957. Slim, spurred by relative success, then recorded a number of sequels to his 'hit', with titles including \"Flatfoot Sam Made a Bet\", \"Flat Foot Sam Met Jim Dandy,\" \"Flat Foot Sam #2\", and \"Flatfoot Sam Is Back\". Slim relocated to California in 1959, but continued recording and performing regularly. As well as his own label, Slim had singles released by a slew of small West Coast labels such as Pzazz (owned by Paul Gayten), USA, Timbre, Excell and Ideel. His billing remained fluid as records were issued showing, T.V .Slim and His Heartbreakers, Oscar T-V Slim Wills and His Heartbreakers, T.V. Slim and His Bluesmen, T.V. Slim and His Guitar, Oscar Wills and His Good Rockin' Band, and T V Slim &amp; the Soul Brothers among others. His song writing subjects rarely traveled far from domestic themes, often delivered with a swamp blues styling. One example was the 1966 Excell release \"T.V. Man\", written about his real life experiences as a television repair man. Albert Collins later covered Slim's Speed Records B-side track, \"Don't Reach Cross My Plate\".  Wills died in a car accident on U.S. Route 66 outside Kingman, Arizona, in October 1969, when traveling home to Los Angeles after playing a date in Chicago.

The adventure was inspired by a black &amp; white illustration with the same title that appeared in the original edition of the \"Players Handbook\". \n\n## Description\n\n \"A Paladin in Hell\" is an adventure using the rules of the second edition of \"AD&amp;D\". The difficult adventure is scaled for 4\u20136 player characters of levels 15\u201320 who have a combined total of at least 2.25 million experience points and are well-equipped with magic items and powerful enchanted weapons. \n\n## Plot summary\n\n The funeral of an illustrious paladin is interrupted when the temple and everyone in it are suddenly transported to the plane of the Nine Hells. The player characters must locate the temple and return it to its proper place.  \n\n## Part 1\n\n The party must seek advice from a powerful but unfriendly wizard, Emirikol the Chaotic, after finding their way through a metal storm that circles his fortress. Emirikol tells them that the temple is trapped between two planes of Hell, and the only way to reach it will be to take a special ship down the River Styx. The ship has a demonic crew who might rise up in mutiny. \n\n## Part 2\n\n Reaching Hell, the adventurers find that even their mightiest weapons and armor have lost some power, and that spells cast by Good characters might go awry or not work at all. Nonetheless, the adventurers must fight their way through the citadel of an archdemon in order to reach the temple.  \n\n## Part 3\n\n Once in the temple, the party must explore it to find a way to break the spell that keeps it in Hell. Their task will be further complicated as they meet the prisoners, some of whom have been corrupted by Hell and are now antagonists. The adventurers face a moral quandry, for if they kill any prisoners, they will condemn those souls to remain in Hell. \n\n## Publication history\n\n When Monte Cook was a young \"D&amp;D\" player, he was fascinated by two illustrations: one in the first edition of the \"Players Handbook\" (1978) by David Sutherland III titled \"A Paladin in Hell\" showing an armored warrior standing on a precipice while beset by demons; and another in the first edition of the \"Dungeon Masters Guide\" (1977) by Dave Trampier titled \"Emirikol the Chaotic\" showing a wizard on horseback casting a magic ray from the tip of his finger. Following the takeover of TSR by Wizards of the Coast in 1997, Wizards decided to celebrate the 25th anniversary of \"D&amp;D\" with a series of \"AD&amp;D\" adventures inspired by the early days of TSR publications. Monte Cook, now a senior designer for Wizards/TSR, created an adventure titled \"A Paladin in Hell\", later saying, \"The \"A Paladin in Hell\" piece from the first-edition \"Players Handbook\" was so iconic to me that, when given the chance, I wrote a whole second edition module about it.\" Cook also included Emirikol the Chaotic as a non-player character.  The new adventure published by TSR in 1998 was a 64-page softcover book with interior art by Arnie Swekel and cartography by Todd Gamble. The cover art was by Fred Fields, who created a color rendering of Dave Sutherland's original black &amp; white image. \n\n## Reception\n\n In the French magazine \"\", Micha\u00ebl Croitoriu was not impressed with \"A Paladin in Hell\", finding it only feasible for high-level \"powergamers.\" Although he admitted that the adventure was \"a veritable nightmare of ingenuity\" and that designer Monte Cook \"had a field day\", he noted that \"For gamers, it's a different story. Between the loss of '+2' to all their weapons and armor, and the proliferation of monsters, one wonders how a Sunday powergamer team will survive.\" Croitoriu concluded, \"If you want good advice, do not engage lightly in this adventure, otherwise you will have to burn your most precious character sheets.\" He gave the adventure an below-average rating of 6 out of 10 \"for powergamers, the real ones\", and a very poor rating of only 3 out of 10 \"for everyone else\".  Wayne McLaren, writing for \"SF Site Reviews\", commented, \"Much like another classic adventure, \"The\" [sic] \"Tomb of Horrors\", this module will find players failing much more often than they succeed. Between the pace that the adventure demands and the harsh conditions of adventuring in Hell, players will be hard pressed to solve the riddle of the temple, much less survive the onslaught of literally hundreds of demons and devils.\" McLaren concluded, \"for all those DMs out there, whether you are looking for something to do over a long weekend, bored with your current crop of players or just want to laugh evilly to yourself while reading the nasty, nasty, nasty stuff waiting for your intrepid adventurers between these pages, \"A Paladin in Hell\" is a great choice.\" In his 2014 book \"Designers &amp; Dragons: The '70s\", game historian Shannon Appelcline recalled the \"Satanic Panic\" of the early 1980s, when TSR had removed devils and demons from their products following a raft of negative publicity. Appelcline commented on the decision to produce a product 15 years later that specifically contained a lot of demons and devils, saying, \"Wizards proved that they weren't afraid of angry mothers by placing [demons and devils] forefront in publications like \"Hellgate Keep\" (1998) for Forgotten Realms, \"A Paladin in Hell\" (1998), and \"Guide to Hell\" (1999). This was an ironic move, as Wizards had removed demons and devils from \"\" in 1995 and wouldn't restore them until 2002.\"", "Mahati": "Mahati It is also written as Mahathi is a r\u0101ga in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music) created by M.

Navarrete was known in the United States, Chile and in the rest of Latin America for his collaboration alongside Don Francisco in the Saturday evenings variety show, \"Sabado Gigante\" (\"Sabados Gigantes\" in Chile). Navarrete began his show business career as a singer for a Chilean musical group named Los Flamingos, with whom Navarrte established himself in Argentina. \n\n## Early life\n\n Navarrete was born in Concepcion, Chile. \n\n## Entertainment career\n\n Navarrete first started out as a singer, joining Los Flamingos when the group was formed in 1955. Los Flamingos were one of the first rock music bands in Chile; they moved to Argentina in 1959 to expand their fame, and returned to Chile in 1962 to host a television show named \"De Fiesta Con Los Flamingos\", (\"Partying With Los Flamingos\") co-hosted also by Enrique Maluenda. Around 1969 or 1970, Navarrete met Mario Kreutzberger, better known as \"Don Francisco\", who had already established \"Sabados Gigantes\" in Chile, and he spoke to Kreutzberger about creating a character for the show who would be the antithesis to Kreutzberger's on-camera persona of \"Don Francisco\"- \"Mandolino\", a wise-cracking, always doubting-of-others character who would counterattack \"Don Francisco\"s assertions to 'lower' \"Don Francisco\"s (the character) self-esteem and make \"Don Francisco\" seem more down to earth to Chilean audiences. At first, Kreutzberger was reluctant to include \"Mandolino\" in the show regularly, but he relented and then, Navarrete began his long association with the television presenter, which extended into well after \"Sabado Gigante\" had been established on Univision in the United States. In forming the character of \"Mandolino\", Navarrete was inspired by the American comedy duo of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. He was helped design \"Mandolino\" by Mexican comedian \"Cantinflas\", who suggested to him that \"Mandolino\" wear loose pants on his sketches. With \"Mandolino\", Navarrete earned popularity in Chile and in the rest of Latin America. When, on April 12, 1986, Sabado Gigante began to be shown in the United States live from Miami on Univision, Navarrete began working in the Florida city. Navarrete worked at Sabado Gigante for five more years but, during 1991, a fight took place between him and countryman Kreutzberger. As a consequence, Navarrete was fired. For a period afterwards, he sold newspapers in the United States to sustain himself. Navarrete also found work for a brief time with Univision's main rival Telemundo. \n\n## Later life\n\n In 2011, Navarrete moved to Honduras along with his daughter Lidia.

In 2021, he ended his endorsement of M5S and Raggi, and joined Italexit. \n\n## Biography\n\n Marione was born in Reggio Calabria and raised in Rome. He graduated with a law degree, but found work as a cartoonist, illustrator and tattoo artist. He took part in Five Star Movement (M5S) founder Beppe Grillo's V-Days in 2007. He was a candidate for the party in the 2018 Italian general election. Marione has taken positions against jus soli, against the euro and against George Soros. He criticised M5S forming government with the Democratic Party (PD) in 2019, likening it to seeing his partner having sex with a friend who had stolen money from him. He has criticised and praised Lega Nord and its leader Matteo Salvini, with which M5S was in government from 2018 to 2019; as someone born in the south, he brought up the party and leader's history of anti-southern bigotry. His attacks on Lega and Salvini grew during the last days of their government. Marione has been accused by various sources of operating the deleted Twitter account @mariusmida which made sexist comments towards the PD politicians Laura Boldrini and Maria Elena Boschi; he previously denied that it was his account, and in 2018 said that screenshots of the tweets were not genuine. In September 2019, Marione was hired by Virginia Raggi, the M5S mayor of Rome, to make comic books educating children on civic values. Jacopo Iacobini of \"La Stampa\" questioned the appropriateness of Marione for the task, due to his history of cartoons making obscene insults towards political opponents. The comics he made for Raggi portrayed her as a security guard and outlining the punishments for vandalism. In December, Raggi ended the unpaid commission due to controversy over a Brexit-related cartoon in which Marione portrayed the European Union as a concentration camp.  Marione declared in September 2021 that he would no longer support Raggi, and endorsed Gilberto Trombetta for the local election in Rome.

The elephant is thought to be one given by Egypt to Louis IX of France as a diplomatic gift during the Seventh Crusade. The animal was given to Henry III as he was travelling through France in late 1254. It was kept for a while at Wissant on the northern French coast, whilst transport was arranged to England. The elephant arrived in England in early 1255 and a special house for it was constructed at the Lion's Tower of the Tower of London. It was the first elephant to be seen in the country since the Roman invasion of 43 AD. The animal attracted crowds of onlookers including the chronicler Matthew Paris who produced two drawings of it. The elephant survived in the Tower until 14 February 1257. It was buried in the Tower's bailey, but exhumed for unknown reasons by Henry in 1258. \n\n## Background and gifting\n\n Although earlier monarchs had kept exotic animals at the Tower of London it was Henry III that established the Royal Menagerie on a permanent footing, with animals being kept continuously from 1235 until 1834. Henry had received three leopards from Emperor Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire in 1235, upon his marriage to Henry's sister Isabella of England. He later received a \"white bear\", presumed to be a polar bear, from Haakon IV of Norway. The elephant seems to have arrived in Europe as a result of Louis IX of France's Seventh Crusade, which began in 1248 with an expedition to Egypt. This failed and Louis was captured and ransomed. He chose to remain in the region to continue the crusade, attempting to defend the crusader states in the Holy Land. Egypt proposed an alliance with Louis against Syria and gave him an elephant to this end in 1252\u20131253. The elephant was brought from Cairo to Acre, along with many freed prisoners, by John of Valenciennes. Louis sent the animal back to France and returned there himself in July 1254. In November and December 1254 Henry III, travelling through France on his return from Gascony to England, met Louis at Orleans and Paris. During their meetings Henry demanded the return of the French provinces lost by his father, John, though the meetings were generally amicable and the men were brothers-in-law, Henry's wife Eleanor being a sister of Louis' wife Margaret. Louis is thought to have given the elephant to Henry around the time of these meetings. The elephant first appears in English records of 13 December 1254 when Henry, who was then travelling from Paris to England, appointed his clerk, Peter of Gannoc, as the animal's keeper. Peter was dispatched to meet with the keeper of the Royal Menagerie, John Gouche, to arrange the transport of the elephant to England. In February 1255 Henry, by then at the Palace of Westminster, ordered the Sheriff of Kent to assist the keepers. The sheriff went to Dover with Gouche and arranged transport for the elephant, which was then being kept at Wissant, near Calais. The Exchequer reimbursed the sheriff \u00a36 17s 5d for the transport of the elephant, with additional funds for the transport of Henry's treasure and messengers from Louis, coming to \u00a39 6d total. \n\n## Arrival at the Tower\n\n The elephant was brought to London and handed to the sheriffs of that city. They were ordered to construct a house for the animal within the Lion's Tower of the Tower of London, home to the Royal Menagerie. A wooden structure was built, which was adaptable for other uses. The sheriffs claimed \u00a322 20d in expenses for the project. The animal was the first elephant in England since those brought by Claudius in 43 AD for the Roman conquest of Britain and its arrival caused a sensation. Chronicler Matthew Paris recorded the event in his \"Chronica Majora\" and noted that \"people flocked together to see the novel sight\". Paris travelled from St Albans Abbey to view the elephant for himself. He noted that it was \"a beast most strange and wonderful to the English people\". He states its age as ten years, noted that it was \"ponderous and robust\" and measured in height. Paris is known to have drawn the animal from life, an unusual practice at a time when depictions of animals were based primarily on convention or by copying from bestiaries. It is believed that his first drawing was the one contained in his \"Liber Additamentorum\" (Book of Additional Things). It depicts the animal in colour and with a separate study of a different positioning of the trunk. The second drawing appears in \"Chronica Majora\" and is less detailed. It may have been based on the first drawing or from sketches, no longer extant, made during Paris' visit. The second drawing shows a more realistic trunk and depicts the animal's keeper, Henry de Flor, to provide an indication of scale. Paris' drawings show prominent knee joints. This is contrary to the prevailing belief, introduced by the 4th-century AD \"Hexameron\" of Ambrose, that the animals had no knees and could not rise from the ground if they fell. \n\n## Exhibition and death\n\n De Flor had apparently succeeded Gouche to the role of keeper of the king's elephant when the latter left Henry's service in May 1255, apparently on good terms. In late 1255 the new sheriffs of London (it was an annual office) were ordered by the king to provide for the maintenance of the elephant and its keeper. From December 1255 to September 1256 the costs were \u00a324 14s 3.5d. At this time a labourer made around 2d a day and \u00a315 was considered sufficient to support a knight for a year The order was renewed for the following term and the sheriffs claimed \u00a316 13s 1d from September 1256 to 14 February 1257, when the elephant died. The animal had been a source of great pride for Henry. In August 1258 Henry ordered the Constable of the Tower to exhume the elephant's bones from the bailey of the Tower of London and provide them to the sacristan of Westminster Abbey to do what the king had instructed with them (this order has not been found). It is not known if the king was intent on recovering the valuable ivory from the animal, planned to exhibit the bones as a curiosity or intended to reinter them. It is possible Henry's order was intended to provide a respectable resting place for the animal at the Abbey, which he had established as the burial place of future kings. Mediaeval bestiaries attributed faithful and gentle virtues to elephants and associated them with the Biblical paradise and the redemption of Christ. Later monarchs kept other elephants at the tower. The elephant house survived until its abandonment and demolition in the mid 19th century.", "Oscar Perea": "Oscar Andres Perea Abonce (born 27 September 2005) is a Colombian footballer currently playing as a forward for Atl\u00e9tico Nacional. \n\n## Club career\n\n Born in Pereira, Colombia, Perea's father was killed in a workplace accident when he was five months old.

It is named after Svetozar Markovi\u0107, a famous Serbian political activist, literary critic and socialist philosopher. It was founded as an independent teaching institution in 1963, but its roots stem from the Novi Sad Orthodox Gymnasium which was founded in 1811. The school provides education for grades 9 through 12, with 36 classrooms in total. Classes are done through a general course in Serbian and Hungarian. \n\n## History\n\n \n\n## Beginnings\n\n The history of Svetozar Markovi\u0107 Gymnasium is inextricably linked to other Novi Sad gymnasiums. Three gymnasiums opened on 28 February 1945: \"Men's Real Gymnasium\" (located in the \"Platoneuma\" building); \"Women's Real Gymnasium\", which started in the building of the former \"Serbian Civic School\" (men's and women's) in Nego\u0161eva 22, and just across the street in Nego\u0161eva 9, in the building of the Catholic monastery \"Kloster\" (former residence of \"Isidor Baji\u0107 Music School\"), where for a time the \"Hungarian Civic School\" moved into the \"Mixed real gymnasium\". At Futo\u0161ka Street (in the building of today's \"Mihajlo Pupin Electrical School\") was the \"\u0110uro Dani\u010di\u0107 Gymnasium\" done in Serbian and \"Pap Pavle Gymnasium\" in Hungarian, which since 1957 have merged under the single name \"Mo\u0161a Pijade\". Since the proclaimed principle of the separation of church and state, and since the church has become only one of many social organizations, the school's teaching becomes universal, based on scientific foundations, without religious interference or influence. Following the liberation of all places in Vojvodina and the ousting of the Military Administration, a new stage in the development of education and training begins, the foundations of which date back to the socialist revolution of Yugoslavia and will continue until 1957. This next period had varied phases until the first major school reforms in the early 1960s. The very beginning is characterized by expansion and the desire to educate as many citizen as possible. This was also the case in Novi Sad and in the \"Higher Mixed Gymnasium\", where in the first years after the revolution the school's eighth grade had more than a 1,000 pupils. \n\n## Reforms and naming\n\n Soon after schools started moving, finding new, larger and more appropriate areas for teaching. \"Mixed Gymnasium\" moves from \"Kloster\" to the \"Serbian Grand Orthodox Gymnasium\" (today's Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj Gymnasium) building on 30 June 1945, from which the Bulgarian army finally left, while \"Men's Real Gymnasium\" moved from \"Platoneum\" to JNA Street 77 (building of today's Electrical School). The \"Real\" status was removed from gymnasiums in 1948. The Men's consistently remained \"Men's Gymnasium\" until 1950, while the \"Mixed Gymnasium\" became the \"Complete Mixed Gymnasium\" in 1949. In 1951, they both became more mixed gymnasiums because Men's and Women's Gymnasium were merged. Soon, both First and Second Mixed Gymnasium were moved to an old high school building near the Saborna Church. In 1952, a new reorganization followed. In that year, the lower classes (from 1st to 4th) were selected from all the gymnasiums and attached to primary schools, so that the gymnasiums became upper secondary four-year schools. That same year, the \"First Upper Mixed Gymnasium Svetozar Markovi\u0107\" and the \"Second Upper Mixed Gymnasium Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj\" were formed. The move, among other things, has meant that most of the major subjects in gymnasiums were professionally represented. In the 1952/53 school year, 112 students enrolled at the 'First Upper Mixed Gymnasium \"Svetozar Markovi\u0107\"\", which was divided into three departments. The Principal was Novak Radovi\u0107. In 1960. National Republic of Serbia has opted for the introduction of two-courses Gymnasiums, the science-mathematics and humanities-linguistics courses has been introduced. In the 1959/1960 school year there was a merger of the \"Svetozar Markovi\u0107\" and \"Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj\" mixed gymnasiums into a single school, attended by 787 students that year. \n\n## First gymnasium re-founding\n\n Svetozar Markovic Gymnasium was re-established in 1963. Teachings started in the building of the then Electrical School near the Post Office building. The electrical school occupied the ground floor and the first floor, and the gymnasium occupied the second floor. Preparations for work were made at the \"Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj Gymnasium\" and the \"Mo\u0161a Pijade Gymnasium\". At the \"Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj Gymnasium\" in the previous 1962/63 school years, there were two second year classrooms (one humanities-linguistics and the other science-mathematics) and four first year classrooms, prepared for the transition to the new Gymnasium. These departments did not even teach in the \"Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj Gymnasium\" building, but in the \u0110or\u0111e Nato\u0161evi\u0107 primary school building. A number of professors have graduated from \"Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj\" and \"Mo\u0161a Pijade\" gymnasiums moved to the new gymnasium. After 1966, the \"Svetozar Markovi\u0107 Gymnasium\" was officially elected by the Republican Institute for Basic Education and Teacher Education as an \"experimental\" school, in which theses programs on pupil education would be carry out. Since 1971, the gymnasium has moved to the building where it is housed today. In the 1970s, the school taught a joint secondary education program. This type of class lasted until 1983. \n\n## Reorganization and change of purpose\n\n In 1983, the gymnasium has been re-organised and is changing its name to the \"Pedagogy Academy OOUR Secondary School Svetozar Markovi\u0107\".

It has traditionally been regarded as a prestige dialect over other forms of Moroccan Darija\u2014particularly those seen as rural or \"'ar\u016bbi\" ( \"of the rural Arabs\")\u2014due to its \"association with the socio-economic power and dominance that its speakers enjoy at the national level,\" in the words of Mohammed Errihani.  Like other urban Moroccan dialects, it is considered \"pre-Hilalian\". \"Pre-Hilalian\" in this context refers to dialects believed to descend from the Arabic spoken in the region prior to the arrival of the Banu Hilal and the Banu Ma'qil tribes that began in the 12th century. After this event, \"Hilalian\" dialects became dominant in the rural regions of central Morocco and are a major component of wider Moroccan Arabic today. It has traditionally had distinctive linguistic features, many of which were shared with other pre-Hilalian dialects in the region: on the phonological level, these include the stereotypical use of a postalveolar approximant (like the American pronunciation of /\u0279/ in the word \"red\") in the place of a trilled [r] for /\u0631/, or a pharyngealized glottal stop or voiceless uvular plosive in the place of a voiced velar plosive ([g]) for /\u0642/. On the morphosyntactic level, gender distinction in pronouns and verb inflections is neutralized in the second person singular. Due to social and demographic changes that started in the 20th century such as mass rural migration into the city and the departure of most of the city's old urban elites to Casablanca, these old linguistic features are no longer dominant in the speech of Arabic speakers in Fes today.

Of the greatest academic interest was a water channel for paddy fields from the early Yayoi period and a rectangular building site contained the traces of circular pit dwellings and raised pillar warehouse from the early Yayoi period. This was the first time in Japan that a village and paddy field from the early Yayoi period had been discovered. The settlement was on a slight highland formed in the delta area of the Asahi River, with the paddy fields in a very narrow swampy area of 3 to 5 acres. The presence of rice pollen, seeds and leaves of various paddy weeds also proved that the paddy soil itself remained in situ. The boundary between the paddy field and the swamp itself was demarcated by a row of piles, and the boundary with the slightly elevated land was demarcated by a row of planks, but no fortification of the settlement was found. Later investigation found that more paddy fields of the early Yayoi period demarcated by ridges were scattered over a wide area. A large number of wooden artifacts and shards of Yayoi pottery were also found.  The site is now an archaeological park with reconstructions of pit dwellings and raised-floor warehouses, and paddy fields.

With a record of 59\u201384, playing the season under the direction of manager Bobby Byrne, Miami finished 43.5 games behind the first place Independence Producers (103\u201338), who finished 19.0 games ahead of the second place Muskogee Mets. The 1921 final standings featured the Independence Producers, followed by the Muskogee Mets (93\u201356), Pittsburg Pirates (87\u201363), Coffeyville Refiners (71\u201372), Sapulpa Sappers (68\u201376), Bartlesville Braves (64\u201380), Miami Indians (59\u201384) and Parsons Parsons / Cushing Oilers (34\u2013110). Miami players Ray Flaskamper and Bill Walker advanced to play major league baseball. Invited by Benny Meyer, Walker was discovered by scouts at a tryout at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis in 1921. After the tryout, Walker was put under contract and assigned to play for Miami at age 17. Walker later won the National League ERA title in 1929 and 1931, making the 1935 All-Star team. Miami Player/manager Bobby Byrne had previously played eleven seasons in the major leagues. In 1922, the Southwestern League became a Class C level League, however the Miami franchise did not return to league play. Miami next hosted minor league baseball with the 1946 Miami Blues, an affiliate of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began a seven-year stretch as members of the Class D level Kansas-Oklahoma-Missouri League. \n\n## The ballpark\n\n The Miami Indians played 1921 home minor league games at Miami Park. Later called \"League Park\" during the 1921 season, the ballpark was within the public park, known as Riverview Park. Riverview Park was opened in 1917 and the park has been prone to flooding in its location on the Neosho River. 1921 ticket prices were .25 cents for children, .50 cents for general admission, .75 cents for a grandstand seat and $1.00 for a box seat.

After a long history of controversial classifications, in 2021 it was recognized as a phylogenetically distinct lineage from the rest of ochrophyte classes. \n\n## Taxonomy\n\n \n\n## History of classification\n\n After its description in 1937, \"Olisthodiscus\" was placed in Xanthophyceae. In 1985, a study of the ultrastructure of a Japanese strain of \"Olisthodiscus\" concluded that it would be more appropriately placed in the Raphidophyceae. However, publications from 1980 to 1992 noted the differences between \"Olisthodiscus\" and other raphidophytes, since it lacked ejectile organelles and had a yellowish colour; additionally, it was observed that the flagellar root system was more similar to chrysophytes and brown algae than to raphidophytes. Despite the differences, a revision in 1992 did not accept these arguments and preferred to maintain \"Olisthodiscus\" in Raphidophyceae. A thesis from 1999 proposed Olisthodiscophyceae as a separate class for the first time, but it was never published in a peer-reviewed journal. With the use of molecular phylogenetic analyses, \"Olisthodiscus\" appeared as a branch outside Raphidophyceae or any other described ochrophyte class. Because of this, in 2013 it was assigned to a new subclass Sulcophycidae as part of class Hypogyristea, along with pelagophytes and dictyophytes, although with low support for the monophyly of this class. It was proposed that \"Sulcochrysis\" belonged to this class along with \"Olisthodiscus\", but due to lack of DNA sequences from this organism it could not be confirmed. \n\n## Present classification\n\n In 2021 a study investigated \"Olisthodiscus\" and proved it is a separate phylogenetic lineage.

It was established in 1891 by the Kings River Lumber Company and was connected to the Sequoia Railroad, which brought logs to the town to be turned into rough lumber. The lumber was then transported by log flume to Sanger, a journey of 54 miles. At its peak, Millwood had a population of over 2,000 people and featured two hotels, a summer school, and a post office. However, today there are no remaining structures or buildings at the Millwood site. \n\n## History\n\n In 1888, the Kings River Lumber Company was founded by Hiram T. Smith and Austin D. Moore. As part of their operation, they constructed the Millwood sawmill, a high-elevation mill located near the headwaters of the Kings River. The mill was connected to a 54-mile log flume, which transported lumber from the mill to the town of Sanger. Sequoia Lake, a man-made reservoir, served as the source of water for the flume. In the late 1800s, Millwood was a thriving lumber city with a workforce of over 2,000 people during the April to November lumber season. The town had a range of amenities including a summer school, post office, store, blacksmith shop, and butcher shop. Loggers lived in rough dormitories and ate at a common cookhouse. There were also two hotels, the Sequoia Hotel and the Red House Hotel, which provided meals and beds for two-bits each. There were also summer shacks available for rent. There was a red-light district a mile south of the main town. In the early 1890s, Fresno County built a new stage road connecting the town of Sanger to Millwood, improving access to the Sierra region. This led to an increase in people visiting the Converse Basin Grove and the newly established General Grant National Park. The stagecoach journey took 12 hours and covered a distance of 47 miles, running three times per week. However, the stagecoach also became a target for robberies, with outlaws Christopher Evans and John Sontag carrying out a holdup on the Millwood coach in 1892. Pioneer photographer C.C. Curtis established a photography studio in Millwood, near the Sequoia Hotel, between 1887 and 1893. During this time, he used large scale glass plate negatives to photograph the loggers and tourists in the area. The surviving images captured by Curtis are some of the only surviving photographs of the giant sequoia logging era. \n\n## Decline\n\n In 1905, the Hume-Bennett Lumber Company, the successor to the Kings River Lumber Company, relocated its logging operations to a new site and established the town of Hume. The company built a new logging complex, which included Hume Lake. This became the new center of economic activity in the area. As a result, Millwood quickly declined. The landmark White House Hotel burned in 1908. By 1909, the mill had closed and the remaining machinery moved the ten miles to Hume.  Today, Millwood is a ghost town with no remaining buildings. The town's former site is currently marked by a United States Forest Service off-highway vehicle (OHV) area.

In some situations, UP can also be utilized to carry other cell-wall polysaccharides, but UP is the designated lipid carrier for peptidoglycan. During the process of carrying the peptidoglycan across the cell membrane, \"N\"-acetylglucosamine and \"N\"-acetylmuramic acid are linked to UP on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane before being carried across. UP works in a cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation as the lipid carrier gets used, recycled, and reacts with undecaprenyl phosphate. This type of synthesis is referred to as \"de novo\" synthesis where a complex molecule is created from simpler molecules as opposed to a complete recycle of the entire structure. The synthesis of UP differs between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In Gram-positive bacteria, undecaprenol is found in vast quantities, which is then phosphorylated into UP. For Gram-negative bacteria however, there has yet to be any indication that they contain any undecaprenol at all. Instead of having an undecaprenol be phosphorylated, it appears that instead, Gram-negative bacteria undergo a dephosphorylation of undecaprenyl diphosphate which is catalyzed by both a type-2 phosphatidic acid, phosphatase homologue, and a BacA homologue. Undecaprenyl phosphate is also known to be the \"Universal Glycan Lipid Carrier\". When UP is inhibited, the peptidoglycan synthesis is interrupted and it could lead to cell lysis. Furthermore, UP is involved in the metabolism of many cellular processes that can potentially be targeted by antibiotics. Also, it is common for bacteria to use UP to translocate glycan; however, certain bacteria certain bacteria do not use undecaprenyl phosphate as a glycan translocator. \n\n## Biosynthetic processes\n\n \n\n## Peptidoglycan synthesis\n\n UP is involved in transporting peptidoglycan subunits from the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane to the periplasmic or extracellular surface. In the process, UP (also called lipid-P) complexes with UDP-\"N\"-acetylmuramic acid pentapeptide (UDP-NAM pentapeptide) to form lipid I, displacing UMP. From there, lipid I complexes with \"N\"-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) to form lipid II. Lipid II then is flipped across the membrane by a flippase to the outside leaflet of the cell membrane. The NAG-NAM pentapeptide subunit is then added onto the growing peptidoglycan chain, leaving behind undecaprenyl diphosphate. The extra phosphate on undecaprenyl diphosphate is cleaved by a pyrophosphatase and UP is then recycled to the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane. \n\n## O-antigen synthesis in lipopolysaccharide assembly\n\n UP also serves as the lipid transporter for the O-antigen component of lipopolysaccharide. It is supposed that sugars are assembled into O-antigen subunits directly on UP on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. Then the UP-O-antigen subunit gets flipped to the other side of the membrane, where similar UP-O-antigen subunits interact and aggregate the O-antigen subunits into repeating-subunit chains, leaving undecaprenyl diphosphate behind. Again undecaprenyl phosphate is recycled by a pyrophosphatase and flipped to the cytoplasmic face again. \n\n## Inhibition\n\n UP is a valuable transporter for cell wall equipment. That being said, the components necessary for the proper UP functioning can be inhibited, restricting the aiding of cell wall synthesis. As a result, the bacteria's structure is compromised, and its ability to combat lysing is lost. On a larger scale, this is helpful when fighting, or preventing bacterial infections. Bacitracin is an example of one of these antibiotics. It is a generic topical cream used for \"cuts, scrapes, and burns\", possessing \"bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties\". The process is accomplished by targeting and inhibiting the enzyme used to renew UP\u2014membrane-bound undecaprenyl phosphatase hydrolyzing undecaprenyl diphosphate to UP. This renewal process is crucial for maintaining the flow of lipid I and lipid II across the membrane, and without it, the cell wall synthesis process is halted.

The following year, Avalon Hill bought the rights to the game, expanded the rules and republished it with new cover art. \n\n## Description\n\n \"Submarine\" is a two-player board wargame in which one player controls a submarine trying to sink a target such as a freighter or aircraft carrier, while the other player controls the target and anti-submarine defenses such as destroyer escorts. The map is a blank isomorphic hex grid in three sections, which can be transposed to provide new map space if a battle moves off the original board. \n\n## Gameplay\n\n The game has basic and advanced rules. In the advanced game, the submarine commander uses a hidden movement system to plot the submarine's movement one turn in advance, and the submarine is not placed on the map board until it has been discovered by sonar, radar or visual means. At the same time, the anti-submarine player must plot the target's movement three turns in advance. However, the movement of the target's escorts do not need to be pre-plotted, allowing the escorts to immediately react as events unfold. Movement is simultaneous. The game includes several scenarios, which can be combined into a long campaign game \u2014 critic Jon Freeman estimated that the complete game would take upwards of 40 hours to complete. The weapons and technology available depend on the year of the scenario, with technology becoming more efficient and deadlier as the war progresses. \n\n## Publication history\n\n \"Submarine\" was designed by Steve Peek and published by Battleline in 1976. Avalon Hill bought the rights to the game, and game designer Mick Uhl greatly expanded the advanced rules, adding much more complexity to the game. The new edition was released in 1977. Avalon Hill revised the rules and published a second edition in 1981. \n\n## Reception\n\n In Issue 55 of the British magazine \"Games &amp; Puzzles\", Nicky Palmer reviewed the Battleline edition and called it \"an excellent simulation of tactical undersea warfare, with varying types of ships, submarines, and weaponry.\" The main drawback Palmer found was that the psychology of outguessing the opponent became the predominant strategy in the game, which \"at times tends to make the game degenerate into a complex version of rock-paper-scissors.\" Palmer concluded, \"\"Submarine\" is pleasant and easy to play, with basic rules simple enough for beginners, and an advanced version with enough detail to satisfy the keenest devotee of this type of combat.\" Four years later, in his 1977 book \"The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming\", Palmer added that the game displayed \"Admirable accuracy.\"  In the 1980 book \"The Complete Book of Wargames\", Jon Freeman reviewed Avalon Hill's first edition, and thought that \"the hidden submarine movement so essential to the game is handled well enough that the overall playability remains high.\" However, Freeman questioned the replayability of the game over time, saying, \"Perhaps the biggest flaw is that there is an aura of sameness from scenario to scenario; different weapon types and situations are not quite sufficient to keep play truly diversified over a long period.\" Freeman gave this game an Overall Evaluation of \"Good.\" In \"The Guide to Simulations/Games for Education and Training\", Martin Campion reviewed Avalon Hill's first edition and noted that for classroom use, \"More counters than are needed for the prepared scenarios are available as an aid to making one's own [scenarios].\" \n\n## Other recognition\n\n A copy of \"Submarine\" is held in the collection of the Strong National Museum of Play (object 112.689.17).", "2023 Women's EuroHockey Indoor Club Cup": "The 2023 Women's EuroHockey Indoor Club Cup was scheduled to be the 32nd edition of the Women's EuroHockey Indoor Club Cup, Europe's premier women's club indoor hockey tournament organized by the European Hockey Federation.

The Batavian-French flotilla was able to repulse the British fleet and successfully reached Boulogne-sur-Mer. \n\n## Prelude\n\n The Batavian Navy was supposed to take part in the planned invasion of the United Kingdom. To this end a large flotilla of flat-bottomed boats was built in the Batavian Republic, that had to be transported over sea to Boulogne, where the main invasion jump-off point was located. Carel Hendrik Ver Huell was selected to lead this dangerous mission as a vice-admiral. In 1804, Ver Huell already had successfully brought a large Batavian flotilla from Vlissingen to Dunkirk. A fleet of the Royal Navy under Sir William Sidney Smith had tried to prevent this near Ostend, but a combination of excellent seamanship and French artillery from the shore caused Smith to retreat. Napoleon was impressed and wrote to Ver Huell: \"You reminded me, that you are of the blood of the Tromps and De Ruyters.\" The feat earned Ver Huell the membership of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur as the first non-Frenchman, and caused the Batavian government to make him vice-admiral and minister of the navy. He also was appointed commander of the right wing of the Flottille de Boulogne, which formed an important part of the larger fleet that was supposed to invade Britain. First, however, he received orders to sail his squadron from Dunkirk to Ambleteuse, a port not far from Boulogne. Ver Huell set sail on 17 July 1805 with 4 French prams and 32 Batavian gunboats. A British squadron, consisting of 15 warships, which was cruising nearby attacked. After a fierce struggle, the Batavian flotilla, again supported by French artillery on shore, repulsed the British attack and around 11:00 they were forced to retreat. The battle however also forced Ver Huell and his flotilla to anchor in the port of Calais. Batavian vessels, which had remained at Dunkirk, now joined the rest of the fleet without danger. In the morning of the next day however Ver Huell's flotilla was again attacked by 19 British ships, including two ships of the line, some frigates, corvettes and bomb galiots, but the British had to retire quickly. Ver Huell was however forced to leave several vessels behind for repairs. \n\n## Battle\n\n On 18 July at 15:00, Ver Huell's flottila now just 21 gunboats, 3 prams and 180 artillery pieces strong, finally set sail from Calais. Also accompanying the flotilla as an observer was Louis Nicolas Davout, who had joined while the fleet was in Calais. Ver Huell aboard the \"Heemskerk\" and his flotilla, came into contact with the British fleet, consisting of 45 warships with 900 pieces of artillery, in between the capes of Cap Blanc-Nez and Cap Gris Nez around 17:00. Exactly at the moment Ver Huell sailed around Blanc-Nez, at a point where the depth of the coast made it impossible for the French land batteries to support the his ships. The British fleet, which had been on the lookout for the Batavians, was much stronger than Ver Huell's squadron, which had fewer guns and fewer vessels at its disposal. The British opened a murderous fire. Soon several British ships pressed close to the Batavian flotilla but were successfully repelled. They were unable, therefore, to prevent the squadron from continuing its course towards Griz Nez. In order to approach the extreme corner of this cape, it was however necessary for the vessels under Ver Huell's command to move further out to sea, which exposed them to the fire of the British ships, who could now aim their guns at a shorter distance, sometimes within pistol range. In addition, the cape had to be bypassed, a maneuver that brought every ship of the flotilla within range of the fire of the entire enemy force. The low Batavian ships, however, offered little surface area for British artillery while the larger British warships provided a much easier target. Despite the heavy fire, Ver Huell's contingent reached Griz Nez in good order. The British, however, now united their force and aimed it at a point where every Batavian vessel would have to pass. The entire British squadron, a gunshot away from the cape, took up a position. One section tried to encircle the Batavian vanguard, while another shot at the Batavian flotilla from the side and tried to cut off its path. Despite enemy fire, the first gunboat, on which Ver Huell was standing, sailed around the cape without any problems. Because Ver Huell had ensured that the order of battle of his squadron was very tight, so that it could not be cut off, the British plan failed and the Batavian flotilla reached the coast safely, eventually anchoring between Audresselles and Ambleteuse. After one last British attack on the Batavian gunboats, the French coastal batteries, now in range, managed to dislodge them and force them to head out back to sea. Around 20:00 the battle was over. \n\n## Aftermath\n\n With the trip around Cape Griz Nez, another Batavian fleet, of 84 vessels, was also able to make the trip from the port of Dunkirk to Amblateuse unscathed. Ver Huell was showered with praise in France. In the Batavian Republic however, the victory was barely celebrated. Despite this feat, events elsewhere meant that the invasion of Britain was ultimately called off.", "Bar Joseph": "Bar Joseph (Italian: Bar Giuseppe) is a 2019 Italian drama film written and directed by Giulio Base.

His mother, Vimala, was the first wife of Ramchandra Basu and the daughter of Raja Pratapaditya of Jessore. \n\n## Reign\n\n Kirtinarayan became the \"Raja\" of Chandradwip following the death of his father, Ramchandra. Shortly after his accession, Chandradwip's Portuguese military commander, Jo\u00e3o Geri, launched a rebellion with 10,000 soldiers. Kirtinarayan rallied the supporting remnants of the army and a three-day battle occurred between the two forces in Ballabhpur.Many of Chandradwip's Portuguese soldiers were killed and Geri subsequently fled the Bakla region. As a result of Portuguese betrayal, Kirtinarayan reorganised the Chandradwip army and supported the Mughal governor Shaista Khan in his campaign to subdue Portuguese and Magh (Arakanese) pirates in the Bay of Bengal. To protect Chandradwip from Magh-Portuguese attacks, Kirtinarayan constructed several forts in his territory. A fort was constructed in the village of Jagua (east of the Kalijira river) and the Raipur fort (west of the Kalijira) that was constructed by his father was repaired. He constructed a moat in Koterdon where he stationed troops, and also constructed some new forts in Shahbazpur. Kirtinarayan also contributed to the development of education in the Bakla region by establishing schools in Madhabpasha, Guthia, Hosenpur, Narayanpur, Khalisakotha, Shikarpur, Nalchira, Gaila and other areas. \n\n## Conversion to Islam\n\n Despite Kirtinarayan's contributions to Chandradwip's military and educational facilities, his reformations to Hindu dietary customs caused backlash. Kirtinarayan was invited by the Governor of Bengal Shaista Khan to his court in Jahangir Nagar (Old Dhaka) to discuss the war against the Magh-Portuguese pirates. A feast was presented with Halal meat, which caused the Hindu community to excommunicate him. Khan suggested that he converts to Islam instead, to which Kirtinarayan willingly accepted. The Hindu elders of Chandradwip refused to recognise his status, and so the Chandradwip \"zamindari\" was passed on to his younger brother, Basudev. Kirtinarayan subsequently resettled in the village of Keora. He eventually married a Muslim woman, with whom he had a son named Mahmud Hasan Taqi. Kirtinarayan maintained his relationship with the Mughals, and continued to fight against the Magh pirates. After being injured in an encounter against the Maghs, Kirtinarayan shortly died and was buried in the nearby village of Pipalita. His favourite horse was also buried not far from him. \n\n## Succession and legacy\n\n Although Kirtinarayan was made to give up Chandradwip to his younger brother Basudev, he continued to possess land in the Chandradwip and Salimabad parganas even after becoming a Muslim.

Signs and symptoms include a high fever, pelvic mass, vaginal bleeding or discharge, and lower abdominal pain. It can lead to sepsis and death. Blood tests typically show a raised white cell count. Other tests generally include urine pregnancy test, blood and exudate culture, and vaginal wet mount. Ultrasound, CT-scan or MRI may be used to locate the abscess and assess its dimensions. Treatment is with antibiotics and drainage of the abscess; typically guided by ultrasound or CT. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a minimally invasive alternative method. \n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n Signs and symptoms include a high fever, pelvic mass, vaginal bleeding or discharge, and lower abdominal pain. There may be urinary frequency, diarrhoea, or persistent feeling of needing to pass stool. Other symptoms may include fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Clinical features might not be apparent until the pelvic abscess has grown in size. The lower abdomen is generally tender; one or both sides. A bulging of the front wall of the rectum might be felt on digital examination via the rectum or vagina.  Complications include sepsis and peritonitis. In the longterm, a fistula may develop. \n\n## Cause and mechanism\n\n Pelvic abscess typically occurs following gynecological surgery and abdominal surgery; hysterectomy, laparotomy, caesarian section, and induced abortion. It may occur as a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), appendicitis, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), trauma, pelvic organ cancer, or lower genital tract infections. The abscess may be in the pouch of Douglas, fallopian tube, ovary, or parametrium. It begins as inflammation or a collection of blood in the pelvis. Other risk factors include immunodeficiency, pregnancy, hydrosalpinx, endometrioma, poorly controlled diabetes, kidney disease, obesity, and genital tract abnormalities. Opening the rectum to resect a rectal cancer may lead to developing a pelvic abscess. \n\n## Females\n\n PID in females may lead to a tubo-ovarian abscess, where the abscess may be in the fallopian tube or ovary.  \n\n## Children\n\n In children, it is more frequently associated with IBD and appendicitis.  \n\n## Diagnosis\n\n Blood tests typically show a raised white cell count, often with a high ESR and C-reactive protein. Other tests generally include urine pregnancy test, blood and exudate culture, and vaginal wet mount. Medical imaging to assess the dimensions and locate the abscess may include ultrasound, CT-scan or MRI.  \n\n## Differential\n\n Other conditions that appear similar include ectopic pregnancy, PID, appendicitis, kidney stone, bowel obstruction, and sepsis following miscarriage or termination of pregnancy. \n\n## Treatment\n\n Treatment is with antibiotics and drainage of the abscess; typically guided by ultrasound or CT, through the skin, via the rectum, or transvaginal routes. Occasionally antibiotics may be used without surgery; if the abscess is at a very stage and small. Until sensitivities are received, a broad spectrum antibiotic is generally required. Sometimes, a laparotomy of laparoscopy is required. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a minimally invasive alternative method. Treatment also includes adequate hydration. Further surgery such as is sometimes required to treat the underlying cause; such as salpingo-oophorectomy for tubo-ovarian abscess. \n\n## Outcome\n\n Pelvic abscess responds well to antibiotics and hydration.

Free and open-source systems can be adapted and used by others without paying licensing fees, improving the odds they achieve the scale usually needed for long-term success. The development of open-source voting technology has shown a small but steady trend towards increased adoption since the first system was put into practice in Choctaw County, Mississippi in 2019. \n\n## Significance\n\n \n\n## Security and trust\n\n Systems where more people can understand more of the process and get insights into details serve a similar purpose to election observers who help to inspire trust with increased transparency and verification. Additionally, when 90% of the market of election systems in the United States, for example, are run by 'murky' and 'inscrutable' private equity companies, conspiracy theories can flourish alongside serious vulnerabilities. With quicker identification and correction of issues than under proprietary systems, organizations such as the U.S. Defense Department and NASA opt to incorporate open-source software. Cities, for example, can have their own staff work on software with the vendors when out in the open, allowing for faster patches and enhancing their election security. The consensus among the information security community is that a widely-used open-source system should be more secure than a closed one, as more people tend to be willing and able to check for vulnerabilities. \n\n## Cost Savings\n\n In addition to increased transparency creating more trust and security, open-source software can lower costs for elections. A VotingWorks bid in a Mississippi county, for example, was 50% less than the other vendors using proprietary software, while its machines in 2021 were listed at 1/3 the price of the average machine. Open-source software allows maintenance costs to be controlled via vendor competition (rather than dependence on just a couple vendors), and to be shared with other jurisdictions as they employ the software. \n\n## Development milestones\n\n In 2004, Open Voting Consortium demonstrated a \" Dechert Design \" GPL open source paper ballot printing and scanner voting system.https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/01/business/technology-briefing-software-voting-software-to-be-demonstrated.html In 2008, Open Voting Consortium demonstrated the system at a mock election for LinuxWorld.https://www.computerworld.com/article/2532223/open-source-e-voting-gets-linuxworld-test-run.html In 2019, Microsoft made its ElectionGuard software open-source, which the company claims is used by all major manufacturers of voting systems (in the United States), however they have come under fire for obstructing the adoption of open-source election software. In 2020, Los Angeles County became the first U.S. jurisdiction to implement its own publicly-owned election system. The Los Angeles attempt at open source voting was dismissed by Open Source Initiative as a failed project when it did not meet accepted open source standards. A condition of the Secretary of State's approval was to open-source the code by October 1, 2021, but had shirked that commitment as of February 2022. San Francisco applied to run a limited pilot in November 2022, but California's Secretary of State asked the City to resubmit their application when VotingWorks' ranked-choice voting module was closer to completion. \n\n## Adoption\n\n Mississippi was the first state to have local jurisdictions use open-source voting systems to cast and count ballots. In New Hampshire, the towns of Ashland, Newington and Woodstock piloted that same open-sourced software system in the fall of 2022 with an eye to statewide adoption of VotingWorks' open-source systems by 2024. Open-source election risk-limiting audit systems have been implemented statewide in the U.S. states of Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia and in local jurisdictions in California, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Washington.", "Giovanni Renesi": "Giovanni Renesi may refer to:", "Kap\u0131kaya, Kurtalan": "Kap\u0131kaya () is a village in the Kurtalan District of Siirt Province in Turkey.

Among them are Otto Ren\u00e9 Castillo and Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias from Guatemala, Guillermo Calder\u00f3n Puig from Honduras, Rigoberto L\u00f3pez P\u00e9rez from Nicaragua , Manuel Mej\u00eda Vallejo from Colombia and Dar\u00edo Cossier from Argentina, among others. The name \"Committed\" \"(Comprometida)\" was coined by the poet \u00cdtalo L\u00f3pez Vallecillos, influenced by Sartrean thought. It had two stages: the first, with the founding nucleus, made up of L\u00f3pez Vallecillos himself, Irma Lanzas, Waldo Ch\u00e1vez Velasco, \u00c1lvaro Menen Desleal, Eugenio Mart\u00ednez Orantes and others. The second, with the emergence in 1956 of the C\u00edrculo Literario Universitario, founded in the Faculty of Law of the University of El Salvador.  The Circle integrated the poets Roque Dalton, Roberto Armijo, Jos\u00e9 Roberto Cea, Manlio Argueta and Tirso Canales. Armijo, Cea, Argueta, Canales, and the poet Alfonso Quijada Ur\u00edas directed, during the 1960s until 1979, the cultural magazine entitled La P\u00e1jara Pinta. The Committed Generation influenced subsequent literary promotions, both for its desire to delve into Salvadoran reality, and for its search for aesthetic renewal, which had the most heterogeneous concretions: from science fiction and the theater of the absurd by \u00c1lvaro Men\u00e9ndez Leal, going through the poetic renewal of Roque Dalton, to the indigenism and popular tone of Jos\u00e9 Roberto Cea. \n\n## Members of the Committed Generation\n\n Some authors include within this Generation the painter Camilo Minero and the writers Alfonso Quijada Ur\u00edas and Ricardo Castrorrivas.", "Brown Palace": "The Brown Palace (\u182c\u1826\u1837\u1822\u1828 \u1823\u1837\u1833\u1823\u1828 \"Kh\u00fcren ordon\") was an imperial summer residence of the Bogd Khan, ruler of Mongolia, located in Ulaanbaatar.

Notable people with the surname include:", "Angel's Share": "Angel's Share was a speakeasy-style bar in the East Village of Manhattan, New York City. The Japanese-style bar was one of the pioneering establishments in the cocktail renaissance. The bar had an outsized influence on the craft cocktail movement, and was among several Japanese-owned businesses on a section of Stuyvesant Street, developed by Tadao \"Tony\" Yoshida. The bar directly influenced Sasha Petraske, who founded Milk &amp; Honey, which inspired bars around the world. The upscale craft cocktail bar had a \"romantic room\" and a view of Stuyvesant Triangle. It opened in 1993. The bar utilized elements of Japanese bartending, including measuring, stirring, and shaking drinks with precision: something still practiced in Japan while the U.S. was in a \"dark age\" in the bar industry. Pioneering bartender Sasha Petraske began visiting Angel's Share in the 1990s, ordering its classics and learning the precision involved in Japanese bartending before opening his own influential bar, Milk &amp; Honey, in 1999. The bar became immensely popular by around 2015, with long lines and waits of up to an hour, taking away from its element of secrecy. The bar's owners decided to open another speakeasy, sometimes referred to as an annex of Angel's Share, above Sharaku, a restaurant owned by Yoshida. The bar was oriented more toward classic cocktails, allowing its bartenders to moreso highlight classic Japanese bartending techniques. The bar operated for nearly 30 years in its location in the East Village. It faced eviction as reported in mid-March 2022; an old lease agreement ended and a massive rent hike would have taken place. The bar's last day was March 31, 2022, involving a line stretching down the block until last call. Later in 2022, the bar reopened as a summer pop-up in the Hotel Eventi in Midtown. The pop-up is also hidden, and has nearly all the same staff, some of the old tables and chairs, and some of the original cocktails. The hotel will eventually open its own speakeasy in the space, and the bar's owner, Erina Yoshida, intends to reopen Angel's Share in a permanent location. In March 2023, it was announced that the bar will reopen, own and run by Erina Yoshida.

The trio achieved national fame as regulars on the Welsh language light entertainment radio programme \"Noson Lawen\" in the 1940s, and have been described as \"perhaps the first Welsh-language pop group\". \n\n## History\n\n The group formed in 1945 whilst the three members, Meredydd Evans (colloquially known as Mer\u00ead), Cledwyn Jones and Robin Williams, were students at the University College of North Wales, Bangor. The trio became a popular act on stage, performing songs written mainly by Meredydd Evans including \"Triawd y Buarth\" (The Farmyard Trio). Evans used a folk music sensibility for the group's repertoire, composing original songs but often borrowing elements from popular pieces and adapting existing songs from a variety of sources. The arrangements were generally sparse, with the group's close harmony singing accompanied only by piano. Triawd y Coleg's performances brought them to the attention of BBC producer Sam Jones, who recruited them to be the stars of the Welsh-language light entertainment radio programme \"Noson Lawen\". Broadcast monthly from Bangor, each edition of the show was bookended by performances by the group; they were nurtured by Jones, who was known to lock Evans in a room until he produced words for a tune. \"Noson Lawen\" brought Triawd y Coleg's humorous and sentimental songs to audiences across Wales and made them household names. At one point it was estimated that 20% of the Welsh population listened to the programme. Triawd y Coleg were the first musical performers in the Welsh-language achieve fame through the medium of radio and they have been credited by writer Sarah Hill for \"creating in effect a Welsh popular culture from the ground up\". Reflecting in 2010, Evans considered the group's light-hearted songs to have resonated with audiences due to the recent Second World War, commenting \"people were wanting a bit of fun, and throughout the war there was hardly any Welsh fun on the radio.\" One of the group's best-known songs is \"Triawd y Buarth\" (The Farmyard Trio), in which Robin imitates a cow (\"Mw-mw\"), Cledwyn a sheep (\"Me-me\") and Mer\u00ead a duck (\"Cwac-cwac\"). Other popular songs include \"Pictiwrs Bach y Borth\" (Little Pictures of Borth), \"Mari Jen\" (Mary Jane) and \"Hen Feic Peni-Ffardding fy Nhaid\" (My Grandfather's Old Penny-farthing Bike). They performed at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1947 and starred in a short film based upon \"Noson Lawen\" in 1950. The group recorded some singles for Decca Records in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but they broke up in June 1952 when Evans moved to America to enrol at Princeton University in 1952. They briefly reunited to record a special radio programme, \"Croeso'n Ol\", in August 1955 when Evans and his wife Phyllis Kinney made a trip back to Wales before Evans took up his appointment at Boston University. A further holiday in August 1957 allowed Evans to record a short new series of \"Noson Lawen\" programmes and a television appearance with the group. The group reconvened again when Evans and Kinney returned to Wales for good in 1960 and recorded a series of singles and EPs for Welsh Teldisc. The group made sporadic performances into the 1980s. They performed again at the National Eisteddfod in 1971. In 1973, Sain released two albums by the group - \"Noson Lawen\", a reunion performance of the BBC programme, and \"Triawd y Coleg\", featuring new studio recordings of some of their repertoire. The group made a filmed performance in Bodedern in 1983. Robin Williams later became a Presbyterian preacher and broadcaster. He died in 2003, aged 80. Meredydd Evans influenced \"almost every sphere of Welsh cultural life, from folk music and philosophy to broadcasting and language politics\", according to journalist Meic Stephens. A leading historian and performer of Welsh folk music and Head of Light Entertainment at BBC Wales between 1963 and 1973, he died aged 95 in 2015. Cledwyn Jones, who later taught Religious Education at Friars School, Bangor, died in 2022, aged 99. Triawd y Coleg are considered highly influential on the development of Welsh-language popular music and light entertainment. They have been described as \"perhaps the first Welsh-language pop group\" and several later Welsh groups followed their model of close harmony arrangements of traditional or comic songs, with comedic routines between them.

The film stars Farren Timoteo as Zack, a young man who works as a shooter boy in a gay strip club but is dissatisfied with his job and aspires to be allowed to perform as a stripper; when called to the office by his boss, however, he unexpectedly finds himself transported, still clad in go-go shorts and carrying a shooter tray, back in time to childhood to revisit the day when he tried to protect himself from bullying by taking the blame when his school's two main troublemakers spray-painted \"DINX\" on the school wall. The film had its premiere screening at the National Screen Institute in early 2008, and was screened at the Metro Cinema Edmonton on March 6, before going into wider distribution on the LGBTQ film festival circuit. \n\n## Production\n\n The film's genesis came when Anderson visited Remington's, a gay strip club in Toronto, while touring his debut short film \"Rugburn\". Interested in the idea of making a film set in a strip bar but realizing that the story of a stripper or a drag queen had both already been done, he decided to explore the story of a shooter boy, essentially the \"low man on the totem pole\" in the nightlife hierarchy. It was shot in 2007 in Edmonton's Starlite Room, with many of its supporting roles played by local Edmonton artists, writers and musicians, including Nik Kozub as the club DJ, Anderson's Wet Secrets bandmate Lyle Bell as a dancer, and Nick Green as Charles. According to Anderson, \"When people see the film at major festivals in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, I wanted them to think, 'Wow! I didn't know that existed in Edmonton!' Which it doesn't. But Bruce La Bruce, when he wanted a queercore movement in Toronto that didn't exist, he made films that made it look like it did. Kids eventually came to Toronto to be part of it and created the scene. He changed the social fabric just by imagining it.\" \n\n## Controversy\n\n The film was a subject of minor controversy in 2009 when, following a screening at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the print was impounded by the Canada Border Services Agency upon its return to Canada, purportedly for a review of whether it violated Canada's rules on the importation of obscene materials. The tape was finally returned to Anderson about a month later. \n\n## Awards\n\n The film was the winner of the audience award for short films at the 2008 Fairy Tales Queer Film Festival.

He was born in Avigliana. \n\n## Early life to 1934\n\n Negarville was born in Avigliana, but his family moved to Turin in 1912, where his father found work as a worker at Fiat. He started working as a teenager as an electrician, while simultaneously following professional evening courses. In 1919 he joined the Socialist Youth Federation and, in 1921, the newly formed Communist Party of Italy of Gramsci and Bordiga. After the 1922 Turin massacre he was arrested and then released, but summoned back to court. He absconded to Paris, where he worked at the Renault factory until his trial in Italy ended with an acquittal for lack of evidence. Returning to Italy, in 1924 he was appointed Piedmontese regional secretary of the Italian Communist Youth Federation (FGCI). In 1927, in Bologna, he was arrested again and tried the following year before the Special Court for the Defense of the State. Sentenced to 12 years and 9 months' imprisonment, he served his sentence in Volterra, Castelfranco Emilia, Fossano and Civitavecchia. He spent the longest part of his detention in Civitavecchia, with Mauro Scoccimarro, Pietro Secchia and Umberto Terracini. \n\n## 1934\u20131945\n\n Released in 1934, following an amnesty, he left again for Paris. The following year he was sent to Moscow as the Italian representative at the Communist International of Youth. He stayed in Moscow for three years; he married the Russian Nora Rosenberg and, in 1938, his only daughter Lucetta was born. In the same year he returned to Paris, where he remained during the Nazi occupation, undertaking clandestine organizational tasks for the party. He returned home on foot across the Maritime Alps in January 1943. Having settled in Milan, he was one of the main organizers of the strikes at the end of March 1943. After the fall of Mussolini on 25 July 1943, he was one of the drafters of the extraordinary edition of \"l'Unit\u00e0\" released in Milan the following day. After 8 September he moved to Rome, where he was among the first members of the central leadership of the PCI. In May 1944 he was appointed as a member of the junta of the National Liberation Committee, replacing Giorgio Amendola. After the liberation of Rome he was the first director of the newspaper l'Unit\u00e0, printed officially after years of clandestine distribution. He was among the screenwriters of the film \"Rome Open City\" (1945), together with Sergio Amidei, Federico Fellini and Roberto Rossellini. \n\n## Political career\n\n Deputy to the Constituent Assembly, he was also undersecretary for foreign affairs in the Parri government and in the first De Gasperi government . In August 1945, as Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, he confided to the Soviet ambassador that his party considered \"Italian demands on Trieste\" unacceptable and that \"the Communists would not have tolerated such behavior by the Italian delegation at the Peace Conference\". Subsequently, from 17 December 1946 to 16 April 1948, he was mayor of Turin, the first democratically elected in republican Italy. From 1948 to 1958 he was elected senator for two legislatures and was then a deputy from 1958 to his death. A member of the leadership of the PCI, he was Secretary of the party\u2019s Turin federation in the years when the automation of the plants was changing the internal organization of the factories and, above all, of Fiat. He ably faced the attack led by Vittorio Valletta, that sought to use these changes to dismantle the workers' post-war gains. The defeat of the CGIL in the elections for the Internal Commissions of Fiat prompted changes in the governing bodies of the party. Negarville left Turin and assumed the Italian leadership of the Peace Movement, a role that also led him to take on important international initiatives. \n\n## Later years\n\n Indro Montanelli reports that in 1956 Negarville was sent by the party to Moscow together with Gian Carlo Pajetta. Here, like Pajetta, he was shocked by Nikita Khrushchev's account of how Beria would be physically eliminated by the new Soviet leadership. Again according to Montanelli, Negarville later wanted to follow the example of Eugenio Reale, who left the party, but refrained from doing so solely because his wife's family was in Russia and therefore feared for her. However, Montanelli's claim finds has confirmation neither from his family members (among them Adalberto Minucci, his son-in-law), nor from his friends. He died in Rome in 1959 due to liver problems.

Several French personalities reside or have resided there. The estate was started by French king Louis-Philippe, and was occupied during the Second Empire by relatives of Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie. It was one of the battle sites during the Siege of Paris at the culmination of the Franco-Prussian War. German authorities occupied several houses during the Second World War. \n\n## Etymology\n\n Montretout is from French Montre Tout, meaning respectively \u201cshow all\u201d, in reference to the estate\u2019s location at the top of a hill, overlooking the Seine and Paris.  \n\n## History\n\n \n\n## Origins\n\n Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, brother of King Louis XIV, granted the land to the nuns of the Order of Saint Ursula, who stayed there until the French Revolution. The site housed then a pavilion for the guards of the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud estate. Napoleon acquired the estate in 1806. Under the reign of Louis-Philippe, the Pereire brothers bought the estate to lay the railway from Paris-Saint-Lazare to Versailles. Once the track was completed, they resold the remainder of the land to a developer who transformed it into a gated community in 1832, one of the first of its kind in France. In 1855 regulations were put in place to maintain land value: these stipulated that the lot must be built within three years of the purchase, and shops, caf\u00e9s, and balls were prohibited. In 1932, the regulation was supplemented by the ban on dividing plots below or doing industrial and commercial activities there. Although it was forbidden, two luxury collective buildings were built there in the 1970s. Madame de Pompadour owned a property on the Montretout estate; it was bought by Charles Andr\u00e9 Pozzo di Borgo, the Russian ambassador to France. From 1896 to 1899, one of his descendants, Duke Pozzo di Borgo, had the house dismantled, transported and rebuilt and expanded by the architect Louis Dauvergne on the estate of Dangu in Normandy, which he had acquired in 1884.  \n\n## Second Empire\n\n Napoleon III became the owner of a portion of the estate; the first houses were built there starting 1850. Napoleon III offered houses to his chief of staff, Jeani-Fran\u00e7ois Mocquard, to his officers and to members of the court of Empress Eugenie. The emperor also gave Marguerite Bellanger, his last mistress, a house in the park. \n\n## During the Franco-Prussian War\n\n During the 1870\u20131871 Siege of Paris, the French troops evacuated the plateau above the village of Saint-Cloud which was occupied by a fortification, La Redoute de Montretout. This redoubt was immediately occupied by Prussian forces. The French attempted to reclaim the redoubt without success in the winter of 1870. On January 19, 1871, the French recaptured the redoubt and the much damaged Saint-Cloud and Montretout quarter during the Battle of Buzenval.", "Chicago Tribune March": "\"Chicago Tribune March\" is an American march by William Paris Chambers, composed in 1892 and published by R.

As an undergraduate, she studied physics at Ghent University. After finishing her MSc studies, she was awarded a scholarship by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and spent half a year in Israel. She decided to stay for doctoral studies, and worked at the Weizmann Institute of Science alongside David Cahen. Her doctoral research considered photovoltaic cells based on cadmium telluride. These photovoltaics have lower costs than silicon based devices, and have a small carbon footprint. Moons was a postdoctoral researcher at \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne and at the Delft University of Technology. Her research considered dye-sensitised solar cells. Moons worked as a research scientist at Cambridge Display Technology, where she worked on polymer light-emitting diodes.

That year she was awarded the G\u00f6ran Gustafsson Prize. At the time, Karlstad primarily focussed on polymer-based photovoltaics. Moons expanded this research area, introducing new materials and investigations into structure-property relationships. Moons works to understand degradation mechanisms within emerging energy materials in an effort to improve device performance, stability and lifetime. Moons' group have helped to correlate solar cell morphology with performance. In particular, she helped to explain how the donor and acceptor domains that form within the active layers of solar cells during solution processing impact their performance. Her work on morphology was supported by the K. A. Wallenberg foundation. Alongside the morphology of the active layer, she has studied how the device energetics (e.g. energy levels of the interlayers and interfaces) impact device performance. Moons has made use of atomic force microscopy to understand nanoscale features on the surface of her thin films. To interrogate the chemical composition of these domains, Moons has shown it is possible to combine atomic force microscopy with infrared spectroscopy. To probe the bulk structure of the thin films, Moons uses dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry. In 2018, Moons was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. She was one of five women in a class of fifty five, and the first member from Karlstad University to be elected. She said she would use the position to advance the role of physics in society.

In 1953 he received his PhD from McGill University on the subject \u201cRotations, Collisions and Orientations in Model Suspensions\u201d (supervised by Stan Mason), and published early papers on the physics of particle motions. He made substantial contributions to cellulose research, but he was the first person to publish the electrospining of a polymer melt. Manley electrospun molten polymers, and showed that they (if thin enough) had a shish-kebab structure. Later the technique of electrospinning was carried out by other authors using polymer solutions. Manley's PhD student, Lidia Larrondo, with whom he published the electrospinning work, was a refugee from General Pinochet\u2019s Chile. He developed a chain folding theory for the structure of cellulose, which was criticised at the time. He based his work on that of the Bristol University physicist Andrew Keller. Keller had come up with a structure for polyethylene that required the polymer chains to fold, in what are now known as lamellae, making up a spherulitic structure. Manley applied the same theories to cellulose, carrying out high resolution electron microscopy. Later it was generally accepted that the crystalline structure of cellulose is not chain folded.

He did some research on penicillin's mode of action. As director of the microbiology department, he hired a number of noteworthy faculty members, including L. Leon Campbell, Howard Gest, and Charles Yanofsky. Krampitz, in a 1956 letter to Joshua Lederberg, proposed Yanofsky for the Eli Lilly and Company-Elanco Research Award, which Yanofsky received in 1959. For the academic year 1955\u20131956, the Fulbright Program enabled Krampitz for seven months to conduct research on tartrates in Feodor Lynen's laboratory, where he met Otto Warburg. Krampitz was one the of most important participants in the reorganization of Case Western Reserve's medical school curriculum. Traditionally, course material was taught by specific discipline (such as anatomy, immunology, toxicology, and so on) \u2014 in the new approach the courses were taught in terms of organ systems in integrated explanations. Clinical studies were introduced in the first year of medical school. Medical students were required to pursue research projects. This innovative approach significantly influenced medical schools in the United States. Krampitz's research involved the use of isotopes in the study of the carbon metabolism of bacteria, until his research switched to biohydrogen in the context of the 1973 oil crisis. In 1978 he resigned his positions and retired. He kept a small laboratory and visited it every day until he fell ill in the early 1990s. Krampitz was awarded in 1958 an honorary doctorate from Macalester College. He was elected in 1968 a foreign member of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften and in 1978 a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. He married Norma Peterson in 1931.

She married the future Prince of La Glorieta, Francisco Argando\u00f1a Revilla in 1874.

From her youth she was known for her beauty and good qualities. She married Francisco Argando\u00f1a Revilla, one of the business partners of her younger brother, Atanasio, after Aniceto Arce insisted to the Urioste family that the union be carried out. After her husband's death she took over the regency. During the Chaco War with Paraguay, he left the country and when the conflict was over he returned in October 1932.

It contains a fable featuring a wren and an eagle. It is an example of poetic expression in the literature of Iraq in the first millennium BCE. \n\n## Story\n\n The minute bird called \"diqdiqqu\" or \"duqduqqu\" (\u201cwren\u201d) in Akkadian is a bird of proverbial small size and great ambitions. The \"Story of the Poor, Forlorn Wren\" describes his conflict with Eagle \u2013 paragon of pride \u2013 resolved by the Sun God. The opening lines represent Eagle nesting on top of a mountain, and Wren in the more humble abode of a \u201cmountain plant.\u201d Wren, described as \u201cpoor, forlorn\u201d (epithets reminiscent of those given to Gimil-Ninurta in \"Poor Man of Nippur\"), is apparently prevented by Eagle from going out to feed himself, for which reason he demands justice from the Sun God. Wren concedes that \u201cmy size may be small\u201d \u2013 after all, he is called the \u201cone-shekel bird,\u201d i.e., the bird who weighs only 8 grams \u2013, but contends that he should still be allowed to subsist. The Sun God apparently punishes Eagle for its pride, whereupon Wren exhorts the \u201cbirds from the mountain and the plain\u201d to sing the god\u2019s praises for making him an equal to Eagle. Eagle should never boast again of the loftiness of its nesting sites, nor should Wren be ashamed of his humble abode. The poem ends with a short epimythium: the beloved of Marduk alone is allowed to nest and raise his progeny. \n\n## Manuscripts of the Text\n\n The text appears to be a late composition, perhaps from the second half of the first millennium BCE. It is preserved in three library manuscripts from Babylon: one of them, MS BabPar1, dated to 69 BCE, is one of the latest datable cuneiform literary texts. In addition, two excerpts of the fable on school tablets from Babylon and Nippur are known, which shows that its celebration of the ways of the humble found the favor of the Mesopotamian pedagogues. The first edition of this text, still riddled with lacunas, was published in 2017.", "Mobility allowance": "A mobility allowance is a social security benefit for people who are unable to walk, or have difficulty in walking. \n\n## Ireland\n\n A Mobility Allowance was established in 1979 for people between 16 and 66. It is paid monthly at a rate of 208.50 per month. There are in excess of 4,700 recipients of mobility allowance at an annual cost of over 9 million. There is also a Motorised Transport Grant for people with a severe disability who need to purchase or adapt a car where that car is essential to retain employment. The maximum grant is 5,020 payable once in any three year period. More than 300 people receive the grant each year at an estimated cost of 1.3 million. The ombudsman recommended that the age limit be removed and the definition of disability should be broadened to include all those with physical, intellectual, sensory or mental health disabilities. \n\n## Israel\n\n The General Disability Pension scheme includes a mobility component for people who have impairments in their legs which limit their mobility. \n\n## Italy\n\n There was a mobility component to unemployment benefits in Italy but it was abolished in 2012. \n\n## United Kingdom\n\n Invalid vehicles, usually single seat three wheelers, were given to disabled war pensioners from 1921. After 1945 war pensioners assessed at more than 20% disabled could opt for a small car instead, and this option was extended to a few other disabled people from 1964. Mobility allowance payments for people over the age of 5 and under 65 were introduced by the Social Security Pensions Act 1975. To qualify a person had to be unable or virtually unable to walk, or the effort of walking would be seriously dangerous and this condition had to be likely to persist for at least 12 months. This only applied to physical disabilities. Ability to walk was assessed with the claimant using artificial aids if appropriate. The Motability scheme was launched in 1978. This permitted claimants to exchange their weekly benefit payments for a new leased vehicle. In 1987 the value of the benefit was \u00a322.10 per week. A higher rate of \u00a324.55 was payable to war pensioners. Benefit stopped at the age of 75.

He was descended from Raja Hari Dev of Jammu. Mian Dido was extremely popular among the common people of Jammu, and even today he is the subject of several ballads and legends. He is considered a hero and propagator of the regional identity of Jammu in political terms. He was killed by the troops of Gulab Singh after being surrounded. \n\n## Early life\n\n According to oral tradition, Mian Dido was born in 1780, to Mian Hazara Singh (jagirdar of Jagti village) in Jagti village, Jammu. He was the descendant of Raja Hari Dev of Jammu after six generations, Raja Hari Dev was the common ancestor of both Mian Dido and Gulab Singh, the founder of the Dogra dynasty and the first ruler of Jammu and Kashmir princely state. Mian Hazara Singh started to train his son as a swordsman and archer right from his childhood. \n\n## Rebellion\n\n In 1808, the Dogra rulers of Jammu were defeated in the Battle of Jammu against the Sikhs and Jammu came under the rule of Ranjit Singh, ruler of the Sikh Empire. Mian Dido was disturbed as he thought of the Sikh conquest as an insult to the dignity and prestige of the natives. Hence, he decided to organize the common people in a rebellion against Sikh authority. Mian Dido, along with his father Mian Hazara, were successful in raising the local peasants and zamindars against Sikh rule. The ballads on Mian Dido describe how the rebels damaged the integrity of Sikh rule in Jammu by plundering towns and villages, frustrating the tax collection process of the tax officials, robbing merchants and traders, murdering government servants and the zamindars refused to pay their dues. The rebellion rapidly became popular as the common people viewed Mian Dido's rebellion as a fight for their honour and dignity. He became a figure somewhat similar to Robin Hood, a legendary outlaw of Europe.  He regularly attacked the town of Jammu, which had a Sikh garrison of about 2,000 men, with varying numbers- 2,000 to 50-60 outlaws. Inspired by his victories, other social groups of Jammu such as the Chib Rajputs and Bhows flared up in revolt. Several ballads were composed in praise of his deeds,one of which is given below: \n\n## Death\n\n When all else failed, Ranjit Singh decided that an indigenous Dogra commander would be able to suppress the rebellion since he would be able to communicate with the natives, be aware of the culture and would know the terrain thoroughly. Hence, he sent Gulab Singh, a Dogra courtier at Lahore to crush the resistance of Mian Dido. Initially, Gulab Singh tried to convince Mian Dido to submit, he would be spared and given a high post in the Sikh court if he stopped the rebellion. However, the latter refused and then Gulab Singh tried to use his kinmanship with him (Raja Hari Dev of Jammu was their common ancestor) as a pretext to not fight. When negotiations failed, Gulab Singh cut off the food supplies of Mian Dido's men. The latter still refused to surrender, and Gulab Singh sent his troops under Attar Singh Kallol to surround the village of Jagti, the ancestral jagir of Mian Dido. Dido was not present there, however his father Mian Hazara Singh defended the village and was killed. Mian Dido fled to the Trikuta hills with his family. When they were surrounded by Sikh forces, Dido left his wife and two sons under the protection of a priest of the Vaishno Devi temple. At this juncture, legend says that he slew Attar Singh Kallol, who had killed his father, and with great composure, sat on a rock and started smoking his hookah. He was killed by a bullet from the Sikh soldiers from a distance.", "Mukadam Asiwaju Asiru Idris": "Mukadam Asiwaju Asiru Idris FCA is a Nigerian government official and diplomat serving as the Commissioner of Finance since 2016.

The album was released in 2009 by Resonance Records. According to Friedman, who briefly roomed with LaFaro in 1957, the recording of the 1961 trio tracks was unplanned: the three musicians happened to be in a studio, and the engineer said \"Why don't you guys play and I'll record you.\" These five tracks were initially released on Friedman's album \"Memories for Scotty\", issued in 1988 by the Japanese label Insights. 2009 also saw the publication of the LaFaro biography \"Jade Visions\", written by the bassist's sister Helene LaFaro-Fernandez, and published by University of North Texas Press as part of their Lives of Musicians Series. \n\n## Reception\n\n In a review for AllMusic, Michael G.

Shaw was accused of the attempted murder and rape of 21-year-old Lillie Davis. Shaw, being positively identified by Davis, was arrested and taken to jail. On the night of July 29, an angry mob shot the Escambia County Sheriff and hung Leander Shaw in Plaza Ferdinand VII. \n\n## Assault of Davis and arrest of Shaw\n\n Earlier on July 29, 1908, 21-year-old Lillie Davis was beaten and found, a victim of assault in her Gull Point home. Davis' husband absent at the time, the assailant raped her, slit her throat, beat her in the head with a Colt revolver he\u2019d stolen from the home, and then fled. Davis' daughter had also been struck. Davis was taken to a nearby hospital. Two hours later, a sheriff\u2019s deputy arrested Leander Shaw near the bridge over Bayou Texar, \u201crealizing in an instant he had caught the negro brute.\u201d The still-bloody knife and stolen revolver were reportedly found on Shaw. Shaw was taken to the hospital Davis was being treated at, where she recognized Shaw in an instant as the man responsible for the assault. Shaw was taken into custody and was held at the county jail. Lillie Davis died three days later, on August 1. \n\n## Lynching of Shaw\n\n By 7:00 p.m., a crowd began to form outside of the Escambia County Jail. Sheriff of Escambia County James C. Van Pelt, after unsuccessfully trying to convince the mob to disperse, was quoted by the \"Pensacola News Journal\": At 8:45, the mob stormed the jail, using a section of the streetcar rail to break down the jail yard gate. There was a volley from the second story windows of the jail building, where several deputies were stationed. Sheriff Van Pelt talked for thirty minutes before him and his deputies opened fire on the mob. A firefight began, several men on both sides being injured. Two people died, including \"Bud\" Nichols, a member of the mob who was shot in the head, and street car conductor Henry C. Kellum, who was shot in the heart accidentally, when the revolver of Sheriff Van Pelt was discharged while in his pocket. At about 11:30, about a dozen members of the mob scaled the rear wall of the jail and entered the backyard. Proceeding quietly, while the officers were busily engaged with the mob in front, the dozen men leaped upon them, kept a number of them to the floor, while others kept deputies at gunpoint. Keys to the jail were taken from Deputy Cusachs. The mob took Shaws, attached a noose to his neck, and dragged him through east on Zarragossa street to Tarragona, before taking him to Plaza Ferdinand VII, where the crowd attached the rope to an electric pole, hung him, and shot his body with more than 500 bullets. In the final attack, H. C. Kellum was also killed.

It is separated from its nearest neighbours (Tunnel and Ranfurly Islands) by a narrow straight channel which delineates the island's northeastern side. The island has only one inlet, in the southwest, but, like the rest of the chain, this is unsuitable for anchorage owing to a reef which protects much of the island's coast. Depot Island rises to an unnamed peak near its centre at above sea level.  The island, along with the others in the chain, was discovered by Captain William Bligh in 1788, and named them after his ship, just months before the famous mutiny on the ship which gave the islands their name. Depot Island's name reflects the location of a castaway depot on the island, set up in 1886 by the crew from the \"Hinemoa\". Captain Fairchild noted that there was no fresh water available on these islands.

The taxon was described by Wilhem de Haan in 1835.", "Pterobrimus": "Pterobrimus is a monotypic genus of stick insects (Phasmatodea), containing the species Pterobrimus depressus, wich is native to Fiji. \n\n## Description\n\n The females reach a length of . The males are long. This makes the species one of the smallest Obrimini along with \"Tisamenus hebardi\". Morphologically, the animals resemble the representatives of the genus \"Tisamenus\", but differ among other things by the small, scaly, rudimentary elytra in both sexes. \"Pterobrimus depressus\" is the only Obriminae species described with wings or wing remains, along with the fully winged \"Miroceramia westwoodii\". In common with \"Tisamenus\", \"Pterobrimus\" has large, laterally flattened spines on the front edge of the pronotum and indicated triangle on the top of the mesonotum. In addition to the pronatal spines, there are only a few spines on the head especially in males. The body shape is somewhat reminiscent of that of flat \"Tisamenus\" representatives such as \"Tisamenus deplanatus\", whose species name, like that of \"Pterobrimus depressus\", already indicates the compressed body shape. The abdomen of the females ends in the secondary ovipositor typical of Obrimini. This ovipositor is formed dorsally from the supraanal plate (also called epiproct) and is serrated at the tip, atypical for Obrimini in Pterobrimus depressus. The first segment of the antennae, the scapus, has an apical outer spine, which is otherwise only found in the representatives of the subfamily Dataminae. \n\n## Distribution area\n\n Fiji was already mentioned as a type locality by Redtenbacher in the species description. Since this locality is far to the east of the range of the other Heteropterygidae, the occurrence there and thus the type locality was occasionally questioned. A specimen collected by Daniel Otte in Naitasiri Province on Viti Levu finally confirmed Fiji as distribution of this species. \n\n## Taxonomy\n\n \"Pterobrimus depressus\" was described in 1906 by Redtenbacher in the genus \"Pterobrimus\", which was specially established for this species. While the species name refers to the flat, compressed body shape of the species, the genus name is a combination of \"ptero\" for Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd pter\u00f3n\u2002 \"wing\" and \"Obrimus\". Redtenbacher chooses this name because of the rudimentary wings and the proximity of the genus to \"Obrimus\", or more precisely to the tribe Obrimini, in which he places the species. He calls the genus a transition between \"Heterocopus\" and \"Tisamenus\" and described both sexes using specimens from the Zoological Museum in Hamburg. Of the specimens mentioned, a damaged male classified as syntype can be found there. A severely damaged female syntype is deposited in the Natural History Museum in Vienna. The affiliation of the genus to the Obrimini was doubted very early on. James Abram Garfield Rehn and his son John William Holman Rehn suspect that the genus belongs to a different tribe. The tribes in question were raised in 2004 by Oliver Zompro to the status of separate subfamilies. He places the genus \"Pterobrimus\" in the tribe Eubulidini set up by him within the Obriminae. Frank H. Hennemann et al. synonymized this tribe and placed the genus in the tribe Tisamenini set up by them. Sarah Bank et al. were able to clarify the relationships within the family in a study on the spread of the Heteropterygidae based on genetic analysis. They synonymized the Tisamenini and confirmed the assignment of Redtenbacher to the Obrimini as well as the type locality he specified on the basis of more recent finds. The full-winged \"Miroceramia\" was identified as the sister genus. Both genera together form a sister clade to all other Obrimini. The genus \"Tisamenus\" mentioned by Redtenbacher is also closely related.

His name was derived from that of the associated mountain, Pi\u0161ai\u0161a, which was most likely located next the Mediterranean coast. He is attested in Hurrian and Hittite ritual texts from cities such as Hattusa, \u0160apinuwa and Ugarit. A Hittite literary text known as \"Myth of Pi\u0161ai\u0161a\" is focused on him, though its origin and the reading of the names of other deities who play roles in it remains a matter of debate among researchers. \n\n## Name and character\n\n The Hurrian theonym Pi\u0161ai\u0161ap\u1e2bi had multiple phonetic writings, such as \"P\u00ed-\u0161a-\u0161a-ap-\u1e2bi\", \"P\u00ed-\u0161a-i-\u0161a-ap-\u1e2bi\" or \"Wi&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-\u0161a-i-\u0161a-ap-\u1e2bi\", which are attested both with and without the \u201cdivine determinative\u201d (\"dingir\") preceding the first sign. It is derived from the name of a mountain, Pi\u0161ai\u0161a, combined with a Hurrian genitive ending and nisba, and as such can be translated as \"he of Mount Pi\u0161ai\u0161a\". Pi\u0161ai\u0161ap\u1e2bi and Mount Pi\u0161ai\u0161a could both be used as the name of the deity, though the former is more common in known sources. True to his name, he was regarded as a mountain god. He is sometimes paired with a second similar figure, \u1e2aatni, though in known texts the latter never appears alone. In the Ugaritic alphabetic script, the name was rendered as \"p\u1e0f\u1e0fp\u1e2b\". Dennis Pardee, who vocalizes this form of the name as Pi\u1e0fa\u1e0fap\u1e2bi, erroneously refers to this figure as a \u201cHurrian goddess of unknown characteristics.\u201d A hieroglyphic writing, possibly (DEUS)\"Pi-sa&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-s\u00e0-pa\", has been identified in Yaz\u0131l\u0131kaya. Relief 26 from this site, which is located between Ugur and a number of unknown deities, might be a depiction of him, though this is not entirely certain. Mount Pi\u0161ai\u0161a was most likely located in the proximity of the Mediterranean coast. Alfonso Archi argues that a list of mountains written in Hurrian which mentions Pi\u0161ai\u0161a alongside Ammarik, originally worshiped as a god in Ebla, can be interpreted as evidence for a Syrian location. It has also been proposed that Pi\u0161ai\u0161a might be the Hurrian name of Mount Amanus.  \n\n## Worship\n\n Pi\u0161ai\u0161ap\u1e2bi is well attested in Hurro-Hittite offering lists from Hattusa. He also appears in ' from \u0160apinuwa, where he is placed alongside \u1e2aatni after the war god \u1e2ae\u0161ui and before Earth and Heaven. In a number of religious texts, such as a Hurrian ritual from Kizzuwatna (KUB 45.21), he appears in association with \u0160au\u0161ka. He was also among the deities celebrated in the ' festival, during which he received an offering of sourdough bread alongside deities such as the \u201cLady of the Palace\u201d and \u0160uwala. A ritual inventory mentions a lion-shaped rhyton dedicated to him. As the mountain Pi\u0161ai\u0161a, Pi\u0161ai\u0161ap\u1e2bi appears in a number of Hittite treaties alongside Lablana and \u0160ariyana, possibly to be interpreted as Mount Lebanon and Mount Hermon (Sirion). In this context he functioned as an oath deity. The name of the mountain is also attested as a theophoric element in Hurrian given names. One example is \u1e2aazip-Pi\u0161ap\u1e2bi, \u201cMount Pi\u0161ai\u0161a granted\u201d from Tell Leilan. Pi\u0161ai\u0161ap\u1e2bi was also among the Hurrian deities worshiped in Ugarit. He is attested in the ritual text RS 24.261 which contains sections in both Hurrian and Ugaritic, and describes a ceremony focused on the local Ashtart and Hurrian \u0160au\u0161ka which took place in a temple associated with them. In the enumeration of deities receiving offerings during this ritual, he appears alone in line 18, immediately after Anat and \u0160imige (line 17), and before \u1e2aepat and Takitu (line 19). \n\n## Mythology\n\n Pi\u0161ai\u0161ap\u1e2bi appears in a text written in Hittite referred to as the \"Myth of Pi\u0161ai\u0161a\" (CTH 350.3). In the beginning, he notices a resting naked goddess, designated by the logogram I\u0160TAR. He rapes her. She seemingly declares that he is now the enemy of the weather god. Pi\u0161ai\u0161ap\u1e2bi, scared of possible consequences, prostrates himself and promises to tell her the story of the weapon weather god used to defeat the sea, which according to Noga Ayali-Darshan\u2019s interpretation was subsequently used by mountains to defeat him in turn. In Alfonso Archi\u2019s explanation of the same text, the order of events is reversed, and the battle of the sea took place after the conflict with the mountains. After this allusion to a rebellion of the mountain gods, Namni and \u1e2aazzi are mentioned in an unknown role and the tablet breaks off. The myth is commonly described as a translation of a Canaanite composition. Volkert Haas agreed with the classification of this myth as originally Canaanite, though he noted it should be considered the result of a long period of contact between speakers of Semitic languages and Hurrian. Jared L. Miller and Alfonso Archi refer to it as \u201cHurro-Canaanite\u201d. Nicla De Zorzi classifies it as \u201cHurro-Hittite\u201d instead. similarly counts it among Hittite adaptations of Hurrian myths, alongside the cycle of Kumarbi, the \"Song of Release\" and other compositions. According to Noga Ayali-Darshan it is more likely to reflect an originally Hurrian, rather than Canaanite, tradition, as indicated by complete absence of Pi\u0161ai\u0161ap\u1e2bi from known texts written in any West Semitic language. She also notes that a phrase describing Pi\u0161ai\u0161ap\u1e2bi\u2019s prostration, which compares this action to the fall of an apple from a tree, belongs to the Hurrian milieu. She argues the setting of the myth might reflect origin in inland Syria. Ian Rutherford points out the story has no clear parallel in any texts written in any Semitic languages. Daniel Schwemer remarks that it shows a thematic similarity with the Mesopotamian myth \"Inanna and Ebi\u1e2b\", but states that a certain connection cannot be established. Taracha assumes that the goddess appearing in this myth is \u0160au\u0161ka, though she has also been interpreted as Ishtar. If the Canaanite origin of the myth is presumed, the weather god is accordingly interpreted as Baal, though he might also be Hurrian Te\u0161\u0161ub. It has been proposed that the \u0130mamkullu relief might be a pictorial representation of the events described in the \"Myth of Pi\u0161ai\u0161a\", with the figures depicted being Pi\u0161ai\u0161ap\u1e2bi, \u0160au\u0161ka, Te\u0161\u0161ub riding in his chariot, and the pair Namni and \u1e2aazzi. Additionally, the appearance of I\u0160TAR/\u0160au\u0161ka and Pi\u0161ai\u0161ap\u1e2bi in sequence in two ritual texts, KBo 14.142 I 10 and KUB 27.13 I 7, has been interpreted as a reference to it.", "George W.

The tower sits on a sandstone and shale cliff that is described as friable and which is subject to erosion, averaging a year, but with the potential for a loss at any time.

It was led by Domingo El\u00edas, and Ram\u00f3n Castilla. \n\n## Background\n\n At the end of 1853, Domingo El\u00edas had accused President Echenique of being \"too generous\" in paying the amount of the Consolidation debt for damages to individuals for damages of the War of Independence. Echenique then ordered the imprisonment of El\u00edas and deported him. However, he then entered Tumbes from Ecuador, where he attempted a failed coup. Avoiding surveillance, he arrived in Ica and organized a group of militiamen to harass the government. Echenique commanded his troops and they fight in the surroundings of Cerro Saraja in a rather bloody battle on 7 January 1854, where about 150 supporters of El\u00edas are killed. At the beginning of 1854, the Indians of Huaras joined the rebellion, demanding the abolition of the indigenous tribute. \n\n## Conflict\n\n The outbreaks of revolution began and in Arequipa, Castilla took over the insurrection. He arrived on 13 February to the acclamation of the people. Echenique sent his troops to the south, but Castilla defended the city with fewer men. At the end of March, Castilla moved to Cusco. On 14 April he received the announcement that the Revolutionary Junta of Arequipa has proclaimed him Provisional President. With a formed army he arrived in Andahuaylas on 8 June, and on the 23rd he met in Bomb\u00f3n with General Del Castillo's division. On 3 July he occupied Huamanga, escorted by the famous \"Morochucos\". Despite the fact that the country now had two presidents, Castilla issued on 5 July the historic decree abolishing the indigenous tribute, which gave his revolution a social character. Domingo El\u00edas returned to the country, prompting the government to send troops against him and to attempt an unsuccessful defense of the plaza of Arica. On the other hand, Vivanco, since his exile in Chile, returned, but did not participate as he felt \"marginalized\" by Castilla. From Huamanga, the latter traced his final strategy. Echenique advanced towards Jauja and thought to have attacked Castilla in Huancayo, but he could not defeat General Izcuchaca's troops in Huancavelica. So he occupied the Mantaro Valley, while Castilla campsed in a poor region and decides to go to the heights to threaten Lima and attempt force Echenique's return. His plan worked. On 3 December in Huancayo, Castilla issued another decree abolishing slavery. On 5 January 1855, at the La Palma hacienda, Castilla's troops defeated those of Echenique, who had to be sheltered in the house of the British charge d'affaires, Sullivan. The Government Palace, the President's house and the his wife's \"quinta\" were looted, as well as that of his relatives and his closest collaborators. Echenique then went into exile. \n\n## Aftermath\n\n With the liberal triumph, a provisional government was installed with General Ram\u00f3n Castilla as President, whose ministerial cabinet included other liberals such as Pedro G\u00e1lvez Eg\u00fasquiza, and Domingo El\u00edas. Following the pendulum trend of Peruvian politics, after a conservative government, a liberal one was given way, although Castilla, deep down, did not believe in liberalism. Castilla called elections for the meeting of a Constituent Assembly or National Convention, whose mission would be to reform the conservative Constitution of 1839. For the first time elections were called with direct and universal suffrage: direct, since the Electoral Colleges would not be elected, but directly to the representatives of the new Congress; and universal, because all Peruvians would vote without any limitation, regardless of being illiterate or having no fortune. Once the elections were held and the representatives of the National Convention were elected, it was installed on 14 July 1855. Its first measure was the ratification of Castilla as Provisional President; then he issued a Provisional Statute, promulgated on 27 July of that same year. In said Statute, which was to govern while the new Constitution was being discussed, the attributions of the Head of State were established and the individual and national guarantees were indicated.", "Gana Suraksha Party": "Gana Suraksha Party \"(Trans: People's Protection Party)\" was founded by Lok Sabha MP, Heera Saraniya and it is a significant party in Bodoland Territorial Council.", "Dharavi Bank": "Dharavi Bank is an Indian crime drama streaming television series by director Samit Kakkad and actors Suniel Shetty, Vivek Oberoi, Sonali Kulkarni and Samikssha Batnagar.

The album helps to document a period during which Taylor recorded infrequently, and captures a performance that took place roughly three months after the one heard on \"Praxis\", Taylor's first recorded solo piano concert. \n\n## Reception\n\n In a review for \"The Free Jazz Collective\", Gary Chapin stated that the album \"adds to the Cecil Taylor oeuvre a nearly perfect 43 minutes of Taylor's solo power recorded at a beautiful level of quality,\" and described it as \"joyfully playful.\" He remarked: \"What once... seemed wonderfully outrageous to me now feels like excellent storytelling. As I get older, Cecil Taylor gets better and better. Can that be right? Of course it can.\" \"The New York City Jazz Record\"'s Duck Baker called the album \"a must,\" and one that \"ranks with the most satisfying of Taylor's solo records.\" He commented: \"The fact that his material was considerably different from what we are used to hearing draws the listener in immediately... one rarely hears how dramatic Taylor's dynamic range was on record but you certainly hear it here, from absolute pianissimo to full fortissimo... One senses in his 1968 recordings that Taylor was captured at an exciting moment, growing into his full stature as a pianist, and we hear that excitement in this record.\" Phil Freeman of \"Stereogum\" noted that, on the album, Taylor is \"going deep inside the piano, and deep inside himself, and the fact that you, the listener, are present is at best a secondary consideration. It's brilliant stuff, though, so take it on its own terms and you'll be glad you did.\" Writing for the \"Downtown Music Gallery\", Bruce Lee Gallanter remarked: \"Taylor's playing here is extraordinary, intense, oft brutal, powerful, diverse, furious at times and unlike any other pianists during that turbulent period. This music, this concert is absolutely incredible and in a class of its own. Are you ready for the exciting ride?!? The take a leap into the unknown and go surfing on the cosmic waves.\" Musician and producer Jim O'Rourke described \"Respiration\" as \"fantastic,\" and commented: \"This is so great, this is AMAZING...

The publisher's stated intention was to bring together those seeking \"sincere comradeship\" and \"like-minded people\" across \"zonal and national boundaries,\" even if they did not want to \"reveal themselves right away.\" Personal ads came from all over Germany, although the majority came from Berlin, with the majority from West Berlin. Often, the ads simultaneously asked for the possibility of accommodation or work, or offered accommodation. In addition, the editor also encouraged placing ads for finding business partners and like-minded hobbies. Advertisements for pubs or events, on the other hand, came exclusively from West Berlin, since the East Berlin pubs wanted to attract as little attention as possible because of conflicts with the Soviet occupation forces. The Amicus-Briefbund documented the homosexual life of the city for both men and women, that was already extensive soon after the war. For example, ten balls were advertised for February 1950, and eight for March 1950. Further advertisements for venues such as the Kleist-Kasino also offered opportunities to go out in between. Since other magazines for homosexuals appeared at the latest from the beginning of the 1950s, which offered editorial content in addition to advertising sections, the Amicus-Briefbund became increasingly superfluous. In 1953 it ceased publication. Knop was active in the Berlin gay scene in other ways besides publishing Amicus-Briefbund. He was a member and on the board of the Berlin Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Reform des Sexualstrafrechts (Society for Reform of Sexual Penal Law). At the end of 1951, inspired by the Hamburg magazine Die Freunde, he founded a Klub der Freunde (Club of Friends) in the bar Die H\u00fctte in Goethestrasse, which joined the Frankfurt-based Verein fur humanit\u00e4re Lebensgestaltung (Association for Humanitarian Living).", "Guilday": "Guilday is a surname.

Soon after his birth, his parents divorced and his father returned to Germany. In spite of distance, Kalmous and his father reconnected during the Prague Spring and remain very close to this day. \n\n## Life during communism\n\n From early childhood, Kalmous has lived in Ko\u0161ice. Since the 1970s, he was in close contact with Prague underground cultural scene. His own art mainly consists of painting, photography and performance art (commonly taking the form of public, non-violent protest). In 1989, he co-founded the Ko\u0161ice cell of the Civic Forum party. On 21 November 1989 he organized the first anti-regime demonstration in Ko\u0161ice to commemorate the killing of a local student Michal Hamr\u00e1k by the Soviet forces during the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. \n\n## Life after 1989\n\n After the Postoj, Kalmus participated at many art exhibitions in Slovakia and abroad. Kalmous considers creating art to be his lifestyle. His work reflects the public obsession with consumerism as well politics, death, religion, sports. He has several long-running projects, including the cycles \"Partit\u00fary\" (Scores) and \"Kor\u00f3zne grafiky\" (Corrosive Prints). Perhaps his well-known long-term project has consisted of wrapping a wire around at least one stone every day between 1998 and 2022, representing the 70 000 Jews deported from Slovakia by the fascist Slovak Republic during the World War II. A Peter Kalous' Holocaust monument, consisting of four glass tubes filled with the wire-wrapped stones, was first uncovered in 2016 by the President of Slovakia Andrej Kiska. It is located in a renovated synagogue in the town of Lu\u010denec. \n\n## Activism\n\n Kalmus has organized several public protests, which gained media attention.

The law also established that immigrants, in particular merchants and small industrialists, as well as those who were not Catholics, the official religion of the Empire, could be elected, provided they had an annual income of no less than two hundred thousand r\u00e9is. The final drafter of the law was general deputy Ruy Barbosa. The law's name was a tribute to councilor Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Saraiva, then President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) of Brazil, who was responsible for the biggest electoral reform in the country until then (Saraiva Cabinet of 1880). \n\n## Background\n\n \n\n## The electoral process in the Empire of Brazil\n\n In the twenty years before the end of the 19th century, Brazil was characterized by being a predominantly agrarian, landowning and slave-holding country. To maintain the order of the monarchic regime, the Empire used a political system in which the two main parties were controlled by the government and the electoral process kept much of society marginalized. It was from the economic progress in the coffee cycle, mainly in the province of S\u00e3o Paulo, that urban groups began to demand greater political participation, the replacement of the indirect electoral system by the direct one and the end of the census vote. According to the 1824 Constitution, issued by emperor Pedro I, Brazilian elections would be for the choice of representatives of the legislative and executive powers. To vote, the citizens had to be male (slaves and women excluded) and be at least 25 years old (this minimum age was not valid only in the case of married men, clergymen, military personnel and graduates, who could vote at 21). In addition to these sieves, the electoral system used census voting, where one would only be able to vote by proving a minimum annual income from employment, commerce, industry or land ownership. With slavery still legal, the census vote excluded more parts of the Brazilian population, transforming the vote into an instrument of political action for the elites of the time. Even with all the requirements, the few people who could vote did not directly choose their representatives; this was because, in the electoral system of the Empire, voters were divided between \"parish voters\" and \"provincial voters\". Parish voters were those who proved a minimum annual income of 100 thousand r\u00e9is to vote for provincial voters, who, in turn, proved a minimum annual income of 200 thousand r\u00e9is and voted directly for deputies and senators. At the time, deputies and senators had to prove a minimum income even higher than voters in order to be a candidate. Candidates for deputy should have a minimum income of 400 thousand r\u00e9is per year, while candidates for the Senate had to earn 800 thousand r\u00e9is. This requirement meant that, in the country's main legislative positions, there were no representatives of the majority of the Brazilian population, which were the less financially affluent layers of society. \n\n## The law\n\n \n\n## The Sinimbu project\n\n In January 1878, emperor Pedro II, pressured by society's demands for direct elections, summoned Jo\u00e3o Lins Vieira Cansan\u00e7\u00e3o de Sinimbu, the Viscount of Sinimbu, to preside over a liberal cabinet, with the task of carrying out electoral reform to introduce the direct vote in Brazil. The law project proposed doubling the minimum income for citizens to vote, from 200 to 400 thousand r\u00e9is in addition to excluding the right to vote for all those who could not read and write - a condition that did not exist in the 1824 Constitution. Before the project was presented in the Chamber of Deputies, some deputies already argued that giving the right to vote to those who could not read and write would undermine democracy. Other deputies, such as Sinimbu himself, then Prime Minister, argued that literacy would be the least one can demand as a sieve of a person's intellectual capacity when choosing their representatives. The bill was eventually passed in the Chamber on 9 June 1879 and sent to the Senate. There, analyzed by two commissions, the bill was rejected as unconstitutional on 12 November 1879. This context was responsible for placing illiteracy as a central topic of discussion at the time, causing the definition of an illiterate person to be associated with a condition of ignorance, blindness, lack of intelligence and political incapacity. \n\n## The Saraiva project\n\n Since the Senate had denied the electoral reform of Sinimbu by constitutional means, the Imperial government had the only way out to introduce the reform through an ordinary law to the new government. The emperor appointed Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Saraiva to institute a new ministry that would have the task of carrying out an electoral reform in Brazil on 28 April 1880. In an extraordinary session held on 29 April 1880, Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Saraiva presented the electoral reform project prepared by his cabinet, where, according to the law, there would be no literacy requirement for voters to choose their representatives, only the basics would be required, such as a signature, to give regularity to the vote. A special commission took care of the proposal and, on May 25, offered a replacement project that had the support of Saraiva's cabinet. In this project, illiterates continued to be excluded from the electoral process, though indirectly, since, although literacy was no longer mandatory, at the time of voting the individual had to write the names of the candidates and sign the date of the election. Even though the project was approved by the Chamber on 25 June 1880, Saraiva's project caused great discussions in the Senate. The senators who were against the project claimed that the illiterate would not be able to have the intellectual capacity to choose a candidate, since they did not know how to write their names with their own hands. The senators who were in favor argued that any Brazilian citizen, who acquired insignificant income or any education, should enter the electorate. The replacement project of Saraiva's cabinet was approved in the Senate on 4 January 1881, becoming Decree No. 3,029 of 9 January 1881, which was commonly referred to as the Saraiva Law. \n\n## Consequences\n\n The Saraiva Law maintained the census voting system of the 1824 Constitution and added the exclusion of those considered illiterate from the electoral system. The very definition of what illiteracy was changed as the law projects on the participation of this layer of society in the electoral system were discussed on the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, coming to mean not only the inability to read, write and perform simple mathematical calculations, but also, ignorance, moral and material blindness, dependence and, therefore, generating the inability to choose their representatives. The majority of the Brazilian population was agrarian and in fact could not read or write. In 1872, the first Brazilian census showed that, for the population aged five years and over, the illiteracy rate marked 82.3% - it is estimated that, for individuals over 10 years old, the percentage was 78%. Thus, the literacy requirement to vote prevented the expansion of popular participation in the electoral process. In 1872, Brazil had 1,089,659 parish voters, which represented about 10% of the country's population, and only 20,006 provincial voters, representing 0.2% of the Brazilian population. In the first election under Saraiva Law, on 31 October 1881, 96,411 voters turned out, out of an electorate of 145,296, less than 1.5% of the population and less than 1%, if the registered voters are considered.  More than a century later, prior to the 1988 Constitution, illiterates were granted the right to vote, with Constitutional Amendment No. 25 of 1985.", "Jordan Ridley (politician)": "Jordan Ridley is an American politician.

This was possible after the impoundment of the swamps occupying the area. At the end of the 15th century, Francesco I started the construction of two big houses, called \"Costanze\" in honour of his wife Costanza Strozzi. During the following century, the first church dedicated to Bernardino of Siena was erected at the behest of Alessandro I. Around 1580, a new house, Cascina Vittoria, was built, named after Vittoria di Capua, wife of Alfonso I Gonzaga. The Gonzaga family often visited San Bernardino to hunt pheasants, partridges and quails. One of the first written sources on \"Terreni Novi\" is about the production of cheese. Giulio Cesare Gonzaga, in 1529, hired Lorenzo and Antonio Busi, sons of the jew Giarono, and rented a farmhouse, with 140 cows and extended grasslands to produce Parmesan cheese. Furthermore some tools are mentioned, such as \"cauldrons, skimmers, wooden moulds, and wooden boards for cheese\". \n\n## Tenuta Riviera\n\n The name comes from the Marquis Giangiacomo Riva, who obtained the area by purchasing it from the Gonzaga family in 1671. The latter used it as a hunting zone since the first reclamations of San Bernardino, which was regularly visited by noblewomen with falcons and falconers. Even after the reclamation works, most of the territory remained submerged anyway: indeed it has been employed in rice cultivation since the first years of the 15th century. At the beginning of the 1800s, it was acquired by Count Venceslao Spalletti. Only afterward, in 1920, the area was drained. As a result of various works of agricultural restructure and renovation of the facilities, it has been converted into an estate, worthy of hosting reputable visitors, such as Albert Sabin, inventor of the polio vaccine, Alexander Fleming, discoverer of penicillin, and Benito Mussolini. Nowadays, due to the abandonment of the countryside, only some parts of the estate are used, solely for agritourism and catering services. The estate consists of a manor house and an oratory dedicated to Aloysius Gonzaga, including also fourteen rural buildings, constructed between the 17th and the 18th centuries, and later converted into farmhouses in the 1930s: these were the first houses in the area to have running water.

Its main goal was to support and popularize Polish art through active acquisitions, providing help for young artists through scholarships, as well as publishing and organizing exhibitions and art competitions, among other activities. The society remained active until the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 and was officially shut down in 1942. The former building of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts in Ma\u0142achowski Square in Warsaw currently houses the Zacheta National Gallery of Art, a major Central and Eastern European museum dedicated to modern and contemporary art. \n\n## History\n\n \n\n## Kingdom of Poland (1860-1918)\n\n The repression that resulted from the November Uprising, made higher artistic education virtually impossible. The last major exhibition took place in 1845. After protests by artists during the 1850s, the \"Wystawa Krajowa Sztuk Pi\u0119knych\" (National Exhibition of Fine Arts) was approved in 1858, and lead to negotiations with Russian rulers who in the end permitted the foundation of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts in 1860. On 13 December 1860, the first meeting of the founding members was held. The board had twelve members, six artists and six art experts, and was elected annually. The members remained in office for at least one month but no longer than one year.  The inaugural Committee of the Society included: Edward Rastawiecki, Justinian Karnicki, Stanis\u0142aw Zamoyski, Leon Dembowski, J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski, Aleksander Prze\u017adziecki; artists: Alfred Schouppe, J\u00f3zef Simmler, January Suchodolski, Rafa\u0142 Hadziewicz, Juliusz Kossak, and Konstanty Hegel. The following were elected to the Accounting Committee: Jakub Lewi\u0144ski, Karol Beyer and Aleksander Lesser. On behalf of the Administrative Council of the Kingdom of Poland, the Act of the Society was approved by the secretary of state, Justynian Karnicki who later would become a longtime vice-president of the Society (1862\u20131876) and a member of the Society's Committee. The Society was initially located at Hotel Europejski before moving to Resursa Obywatelska Palace in 1896. \n\n## New building (1900)\n\n After the Society was given land by the municipality close to the Saxon Palace in Warsaw, another competition was announced in 1894, won by the Warsaw architect, Stefan Szyller. He presented an architectural design in neo-Renaissance style with classical elements. The portal is ornamented with allegorical figures and sculptural works by Zygmunt Otto. The architrave of the building is engraved with the Latin word \"Artibus\" (English: arts). Construction work began in 1898. In December 1900, the newly designed building became the official location of the Society, commonly known as Zach\u0119ta (Encouragement). The building included large exhibition spaces and a dedicated library. It was followed by the opening of the south wing in 1903. \n\n## Second Polish Republic (1918-1939)\n\n On 16 December 1922, President of Poland Gabriel Narutowicz was assassinated at Zach\u0119ta while viewing an exhibition dedicated to modern Polish painting, only five days after taking office. Following the Nazi invasion of Poland in September 1939 and the outbreak of World War II, Zach\u0119ta was shut down and the building used for German Nazi propaganda under the name Haus der deutschen Kultur (House of German Culture). \n\n## After World War II (1945-present)\n\n It reopened in 1949 as the Central Bureau of Art Exhibitions (Centralne Biuro Wystaw Artystycznych or CBWA), becoming an official arm of cultural propaganda of the nascent Stalinist regime.

Grave had been occupied by the French since the summer of 1672 when an army under Turenne forced the town to surrender. \n\n## Prelude\n\n In May 1672, following the outbreak of the Franco-Dutch War and its peripheral conflict the Third Anglo-Dutch War, France, supported by M\u00fcnster and Cologne, invaded and nearly overran the Dutch Republic. At the same time, it faced the threat of an Anglo-French naval blockade, though that attempt was abandoned following the Battle of Solebay. Grave, a strong fortress town, strategically placed along the Meuse river was captured by the French on 5 July 1672 without much difficulty. French advances into Holland, the most important province of the Dutch Republic were however halted due too the Dutch Water Line. A stalemate ensued. After the Treaty of the Hague in 1673, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain and the Lorraine joined the war in support of the Dutch. More and more French troops in the Netherlands were moved to other fronts. This allowed the Dutch to counter-attack; in September they captured Naarden and in November Bonn was captured by an allied force. These setbacks forced Louis XIV, the French king, to evacuate his forces from most of the Dutch Republic. By 1674, the French remained only in 2 Dutch places; Maastricht and Grave. Having lost the support of the French army, the French allies M\u00fcnster and Cologne subsequently made peace on 22 April (M\u00fcnster) and 11 May (Cologne). \n\n## The siege\n\n Cut off from other French possessions, the defenders of Grave under the command of No\u00ebl Bouton de Chamilly transformed the town into a hedgehog fortress. Lieutenant-general Carl von Rabenhaupt was send with a Dutch army supported by some Spanish and Brandenburgian forces to capture the town. However, problems with the payment of the soldiers and logistics meant it took a long time for the siege to begin. The army finally started the siege on 25 July. Chamilly had taken advantage of this time to further strengthen the fortress. The good French defences meant that the siege went on with great difficulty for the attackers. Effective French artillery fire made it difficult for the Dutch to dig trenches close to the walls and the Meuse river formed an extra obstacle. On 11 August Rabenhaupt's circumvallation line was completed so that the attackers could better defend themselves from a possible relief army. The Dutch also diverted the river Raam so that it supplied the Dutch moats with water, while depriving the moats of Grave of water. A successful sortie from the defenders however delayed the advance again. After more slow progress, Menno van Coehoorn, the renowned fortress construction expert, came to advise Rabenhaupt, but the old general (71 years old) ignored that advice. The Dutch Republic, Spain and the Emperor had been broadly in agreement concerning the strategic plans for 1674. They involved the deployment of over 120,000 soldiers spread across three different war zones. The Spanish Netherlands, the Rhineland and the Franco-Spanish border. The largest joint effort would be made in the Spanish Netherlands, were over 70,000 soldiers had been made available, commanded by William of Orange and de Souches. Confident that they would vastly outnumber the French in every front, the allies went on the attack. However, the French army in the Spanish Netherlands under Cond\u00e9 was 20,000 stronger than expected and comprised 50,000 men. This fact combined with poor cooperation between the Allied army leaders meant that the campaign ended in a deception for them. At Seneffe, the Allies and the French fought a very bloody, but ultimately inconclusive battle. William and the Dutch blamed de Souches and after a failed attempt to capture Oudenaarde, largely due too obstructionism from de Souches, he was relieved of command. Frustrated, William joined the army under Rabenhaupt with 10,000 troops instead of campaigning further in the Spanish Netherlands. De Chamilly felt flattered that the renowned William of Orange had come to challenge him, and so he intended to prove himself worthy of that opponent. William, assisted by his cousin Henry Casimir II, brought with him all his cavalry and a quantity of foot soldiers, bringing the amount of reinforcements to about 10,000. He himself established his headquarters in Wychen Castle, and took charge of siege. He did this with as little success as Rabenhaupt had achieved however, for the fortress stubbornly continued to hold out and it more and more seemed as if weapons could not force the siege to a conclusion. Louis XIV's original intention, to bring down the Dutch Republic by invading it, had already failed. Maintaining an isolated position like Grave therefore hardly made sense, and it was therefore not surprising that the French king himself advised his, still far from exhausted, commander to abandon the siege. After a brief truce, during which negotiations were conducted, de Chamilly capitulated on 27 October on very favourable terms and in all-round honourable manner. William of Orange had learned to appreciate his adversary, who had proven to be an excellent match for the besiegers, and his respect and sympathy made him decide to allow the defenders to leave the fortress with the honours of war. \n\n## Aftermath\n\n The exodus of the garrison took place on the following day. On the same day, William of Orange and a large retinue of the Dutch States Army went to church in the heavily damaged St Elizabeth's church in Grave, where he attended the sermon in his military outfit and listened to the sermon of thanksgiving from his also \"booted and spurred\" court preacher 'De Roy'. Grave was effectively destroyed. The number of civilian casualties is not known, but the suffering was indescribable. The more than 100,000 cannonballs and the 3,000 bombs that had struck the town and its defences had caused death and destruction in the fortress, which was only a few dozen hectares in size. The capture of this strong yet small town was a meagre result compared to the plans the Allies had had at the beginning of the year. Still, the result was significant because it meant that all the adjacent lands of the Dutch Republic were now in back in Dutch hands and it left Maastricht as the only yet to be liberated Dutch territory. The siege and the Battle of Seneffe were illustrative of the stage the war had reached. Two years after the French lightning attack, the war had turned into a war of attrition. As armies expanded and the battlefield was relocated, casualties had increased. The Allies and France were of similar strength, but the parties were not yet tired enough of the war to agree to a peace.", "Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis": "The Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis (or veneficiis) (\"The Cornelian Law against Murderers and Poisoners\") was a Roman statute enacted by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 81 BC during his dictatorship to write laws and reconstitute the state (\"legibus scribundis et rei publicae constituendae\") which aimed at the punishment of murderers, poisoners, abortionists, human sacrifice, and malign magicians and was later also applied to the punishment of castration and circumcision. It was still in force in the time of Justinian in the 6th century A.D. The provisions of the law were described by the later Roman jurist Paul as including: The law significantly moved to replace the traditional Roman penalty of the Poena cullei for poisoners and practitioners of malign magic, which involved being sewn up in a sack and thrown into the river, with more standard punishments. The original maximum penalty mandated for convicted citizens may have been banishment to an island and confiscation of property, but by the later empire the imposition of capital punishment in its various forms, with distinction between honestiores and humiliores, had become standard. The law further not only punished the poisoner but also equally, if distinct, the suppliers and manufacturers of the potion which had induced the death. The concern of the provisions against suppliers of abortifacients seems to be safeguarding the life of the mother, for whose murder or endangerment the supplier would be charged, not the foetus. The penalties of the \"Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis\" were imposed by Hadrian on castrators, already generally banned by Domitian, and by edict of Antoninus Pius on all who performed circumcision on males, with special exemption for the Jews.", "Psednos struthersi": "Psednos struthersi is a species of snailfish found in the Southwest Pacific Ocean. \n\n## Size\n\n This species reaches a length of . \n\n## Etymology\n\n The fish is named in honor of Carl D.

He was responsible for the first definitions of fish schools in ichthyology. An undersea mountain in the Atlantic, a Cape on Eva-Liv Island, and a mountain in Antarctica are named after Mesyatsev. Mesyatsev was born in what is now Krasnodar Krai and studied at the Vladikavkaz gymnasium and St Petersburg Institute of Technology before going to Moscow University where he graduated in 1912. He worked on embryology and histology but an interest in marine fishes was sparked after a visit to the marine biological stations in France in 1910. He taught at Moscow University for a while and in 1920 he worked as part of a scientific fisheries expedition into the Barents Sea. An active member of the communist party, he received support from V.I. Lenin for his work. In 1921 he helped establish a floating marine laboratory (Plavmornin) and helped set up the wooden research vessel \"Perseus\" which was used for numerous expeditions. A firm believer in equal rights, he encouraged women oceanographers and the \"Perseus\" mission had nearly thirteen women on expeditions including Maria Klenova. In 1929 he headed the State Oceanographic Institute which later became the VNIRO (The Russian oceanographic research institute) and in 1934 he headed the commission to examine the fish resources of the Caspian Sea.", "Herrick HV-2A Vertaplane": "The Herrick HV-2 Vertaplane (Herrick Vertoplane-2) was one of the world's first convertiplanes and was designed by Gerard P. Herrick, a pioneer in the field of VTOL in the 1930s. Herrick's concept called for an aircraft that had a fixed lower wing and an upper wing that could rotate about the vertical axis. The upper rotor wing could be stopped or started both on the ground and in the air. The HV-2 was the first aircraft with an in-flight stoppable rotor to actually use this compound system to generate lift and propulsion in a number of test flights and to perform an in-flight transition. Modern counterparts using a similar propulsion concept include the Sikorsky S-72 and the Boeing X-50. \n\n## History\n\n The main motivation for developing the convertiplane was to build a stall-proof aircraft. Herrick envisioned the rotating wing as a type of parachute to be used in an emergency during critical takeoff and landing phases. To this end, the rotor wing was to be capable of being started or stopped both in flight and on the ground. Herrick's projects, carried out between 1931 and 1937, differed from modern stop-rotor concepts in that the rotor was not actively driven but operated in autogyro mode. During the development phase, Herrick changed the name of his aircraft several times, using the designations Vertoplane, Vertaplane, Convertoplane, and Convertaplane. The \"Convertible Aircraft Congress\" also referred to him as the father of the convertiplane when awarding him a plaque for his life's work. \n\n## HV-1\n\n The HV-1 was the first aircraft designed by Herrick. The single-seater had a 40 horsepower Poyer engine and was equipped with a short-span lower wing and an 11.00 meter diameter teeter-type upper rotor wing on a pylon above the cockpit. The HV-1 prototype had its first flight as a fixed-wing aircraft at Niles, Michigan, on November 6, 1931. Later launches were also made with the rotor rotating as an autogyro, but when the upper wing was launched in flight, it struck the vertical stabilizer and stopped in the position parallel to the fuselage. Although the pilot, Merrill Lambert, was able to bail out, he was killed when his parachute failed to open. The HV-1 was destroyed in the accident. \n\n## HV-2A\n\n Herrick, with the help of aeronautical engineer Ralph McLaren, then began construction of a revised variant designated the HV-2A. Like the HV-1, the prototype was built by Heath Aircraft, a small manufacturer of home-built aircraft. The upper wing had a span of only 7.32 m to prevent contact with the vertical stabilizer. Test flights of the HV-2A were made by 22-year-old George Townson, who had no previous experience with autogyros. He was paid $25 for each flight hour, $12.50 for taxiing hours, and $1.50 each for consulting hours. The first flight as a fixed-wing aircraft was made on October 31, 1936, with subsequent testing at Boulevard Airport in the outer boroughs of Philadelphia. This was followed by initial taxi tests and flights in autogyro mode. The flights proceeded in such a way that the rotor was set in motion by briefly bumping it while stationary, the aircraft then rolled along the periphery of the field to increase the speed of the rotor, finally taxied to the start of the runway and took off into the wind. The flights were all in a straight flight path at a maximum altitude of only about 15 m. The stall speed in fixed-wing mode was 64 km/h and in autogyro mode 56 km/h, demonstrating that the rotor could perform a lift function. Below 56 km/h, vertical descent occurred without stall effects. Flights at higher altitudes of 400 m and first turns took place between Boulevard Airport and a smaller airfield about 1.6 kilometers away. The first transition between fixed-wing and autogyro configuration took place on July 26, 1937. To do this, the procedure was to tension the rubber cord in the upper wing with two rotor turns and, after takeoff at 80 km/h at an altitude of 45 m, release the upper wing lock. On the first such attempt, Townson struggled with severe oscillations about all three axes that did not subside until the rotor speed reached 250 rpm. This flight is considered the first successful transition of a convertible aircraft. A second successful attempt occurred on July 30, 1937, this time under scrutiny by the media and members of the NACA and military staffs. Between 1937 and 1939, the year the aircraft was retired, about 100 more transitions were made in the air. The aircraft was then transferred to the National Air and Space Museum, where it was displayed hanging from the ceiling of Building 23 in Silver Hill, Maryland. \n\n## Design\n\n The HV-1 and HV-2 concept differed from later designs in that Herrick's rotor was not powered, but operated only in autogyro mode. The HV-2A was powered by a 5-cylinder Kinner radial engine. The lower wing had a Clark-Y airfoil, a structure of wood with plywood planking. The upper wing, also constructed of wood with a Herrick M-7-II airfoil, had double planking. The symmetrical airfoil, with a curved top and flat bottom, had a depth of 1.20 m at the center, tapering to 0.60 m at the wingtips. The fuselage and empennage were fabric-covered and conventionally constructed of welded tubes. The cost of construction was reported to have been $1500. The rotating surface had no control system and was equipped only with an unlocking lever. In the locked position, the upper wing was oriented parallel to the lower wing; after unlocking, the upper wing began to rotate as a rotor. As with the HV-1, this was mounted on a pivot. A hinge joint allowed a \"rocking\" motion, i.e., the rotor moved upward when turning toward the nose and downward when turning backward. A hydraulic damping system limited the swings. In order to start the rotor rotating after the rotor lock was released, even in possible emergencies where rotation was not automatically initiated, the HV-2A had a special Bendix ignition system. This consisted of a small turbine, a drive shaft, and a latch containing a cartridge with igniter. After the latch was opened, the fuze was triggered electrically. The gases from the cartridge, which passed through a tube, drove the turbine, which acted on the drive shaft. This brought the rotor up to a speed of about 60 per minute within a few revolutions. The airstream then ensured that a stable speed of about 250/min was eventually established. However, this emergency system was never used during testing. If the rotor was already set in rotation on the ground, this was done according to the following procedure: With the help of four people (two at each rotor tip), a rubber cable, which was located in a tube inside the wing, was stretched by turning the rotor backward two turns. The cable was connected to another cable that was wrapped around a drum on the rotor head. After releasing the cable, the rotor accelerated to a speed of about 60 r/min.", "George M.

It was established in 1979 by a decree issued by Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. The ministry undertakes the media, intellectual and cultural policy and contributes to sponsoring art. The Ministry of Information is also concerned with tourism and antiquities affairs.  The current Minister is Abdulrahman Badah Al-Mutairi. \n\n## Ministry History\n\n The year 1954 witnessed the beginning of Kuwait's media march. The Official Gazette was established, and shortly after its issuance, it was attached with its printing presses to the Department of Printing and Publishing, which was established in 1955 and headed at the time by Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad. In 1959, the Emiri decree was issued, which stipulated the term \u201cPress and Publishing Department for all issues related to the press.\u201d At the beginning of 1962, government departments were transformed into ministries and the official name of the Department of Governmental Publications and Publishing became \u201cMinistry of Guidance and News\u201d. The Radio and Television Department was attached to it and took over control of all Publication media and films, which were taken over by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor and renamed it in February 1971, becoming the Ministry of Information. As for Kuwait Radio, the sound \u201cHere is Kuwait\u201d was launched for the first time in 1951. The half-century development of work in the radio and media efforts resulted in the emergence of eight radio stations within the framework of Radio Kuwait, broadcasting their programs in four languages for a period of 72 hours a day. Kuwait TV started fast and developed steps since 1961. The Ministry of Guidance and News at that time took over the responsibility for television broadcasting. In 1969, Kuwait established a television transmission station in Dubai under the name \u201cKuwait TV from Dubai.\u201d \n\n## Ministry missions and objectives\n\n In 2021, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Information and Culture launched a five-year strategy. As part of its attempt to develop the official media in the country and enable it to play an influential role in society through the various tools it possesses. The strategy was prepared under the directives of the political leadership in Kuwait, with the aim of developing the government media apparatus in Kuwait to exercise its role to complete the development process.

The genus contains a single species, P. walkeri, known from a partial skeleton. \n\n## Discovery and naming\n\n The holotype specimen, UNSM 50134, was discovered by Joe Purzer, an oil field geologist, in 1931 near the town of Holyrood, Kansas. He notified George F. Sternberg and Myrl V. Walker, and the excavation of the specimen commenced later in the year. It was collected over a period of ten days in October 1931. The specimen became known as the 'Holyrood elasmosaur' and was eventually sold to the University of Nebraska State Museum in 1935, where it was prepared and placed into storage. Everhart (2007) noted that Harold Ehler used photographs of the holotype to identify the type locality, but no further remains of \"Plesioelasmosaurus\" resulted from Ehler's discovery. The holotype consists of both ilia, partial hind paddles, a nearly complete fore paddle, vertebrae from all sections of the vertebral column (cervical, 'pectoral', dorsal, sacral, and caudal), ribs and gastralia, two teeth, and more than two hundred gastroliths, all from a single individual. One of these front paddles is still on display at the UNSM today. In 2022, \"Plesioelasmosaurus walkeri\" was described as a new genus and species of elasmosaurid plesiosaur by Schumacher &amp; Everhart based on these remains.The generic name, \"Plesioelasmosaurus\", is derived from the Greek words \"plesio\", meaning \"near to\", \"elasmo\" meaning \"metal plate\", and \"saurus\", meaning \"lizard\". The specific name, \"walkeri\", honors paleontologist Myrl Walker, one of the collectors of the holotype. \n\n## Description\n\n A photograph of a front flipper of \"Plesioelasmosaurus\", taken in the 1930s by George F. Sternberg, was captioned as belonging to \"a large plesiosaur, which would have measured from 40 to 60 feet in length\" (12.2 to 18.3 m).

The song is about the life of coal miners within the state of Kentucky. Scott said the inspiration for the song came from a visit to Harlan County, Kentucky, in an attempt to research his own family history. While in a cemetery attempting to find his great-grandfather's grave, he saw the phrase \"you'll never leave Harlan alive\" on a tombstone. The writers of the \"Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings\" described the song's plot line as being about \"a federal lawman who had left his native Harlan County...but winds up dealing with adversaries back on the old home turf.\" While the lyrics contain no reference to a federal lawman, the song was used in several episodes of the similarly themed \"Justified\". Following Scott's original version, country music singer Patty Loveless recorded it in 2001 for her album \"Mountain Soul\". Loveless' rendition featured Scott playing banjo. According to Scott, Loveless had difficulty singing the song at first. Her producer and husband, Emory Gordy Jr., placed a picture of Loveless' father (who was a coal miner) before her and told her to \"sing the song to her father\". In 2002, Loveless' rendition was nominated at the International Bluegrass Music Awards for Song of the Year. The same year as Loveless, Brad Paisley covered the song on his album \"Part II\". Paisley said that he chose to record the song because, being a native of West Virginia, he had seen the effect that coal mining had on communities in that region. Kathy Mattea also covered it on her 2008 album \"Coal\", a concept album themed around coal mining. Montgomery Gentry recorded it for their 2019 album \"Outskirts\".

The council initially established its offices at Abram Brow, just off Warrington Road. Abram became an urban district in 1894 and, in this context, civic leaders decided to erect new offices on the east side of Warrington Road.

The building was designed by Heaton, Ralph and Heaton in the Edwardian Baroque style, built in red brick and was completed in 1903. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of five bays facing onto Warrington Road. The central bay featured a doorway with an architrave and a keystone inscribed with the date of completion. The doorway was flanked by ornately carved columns supporting a cornice, above which there was a stone panel inscribed with the words \"ADC Offices\".

The Moroccan army, mainly composed of the Black Guard, commanded by Moulay Zidan, managed to chase the Turks from Tlemcen. The Moroccan army besieged the city defended by armed Kouloughlis whom were the main inhabitants of the city, and even pushed as far as Mascara, the capital of the Western Beylik, whose Bey Othman was absent due to an expedition. The Moroccans ravaged the whole region, ransacked the city, even looting the Bey's palace. However, perhaps to save his loot, Moulay Zidan returned to Morocco after agreeing to a peace negotiation with the Turks, which angered Moulay Ismail because it allowed the Dey of Algiers to concentrate on its eastern front against the army of the Bey of Tunis, which he crushed between Setif and Constantine.

Due to francium being very unstable, its salts are only known to a small extent. Francium coprecipitates with several caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate. This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and C. M. Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the tartrate (also rubidium tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which leads to other methods of separation. \n\n## Halides\n\n Francium halides are all soluble in water and are expected to be white solids. They are expected to be produced by the reaction of the corresponding halogens. For example, francium chloride would be produced by the reaction of francium and chlorine. Francium chloride has been studied as a pathway to separate francium from other elements, by using the high vapour pressure of the compound, although francium fluoride would have a higher vapour pressure. \n\n## Other compounds\n\n Francium nitrate, sulfate, hydroxide, carbonate, acetate, and oxalate, are all soluble in water, while the iodate, picrate, tartrate, chloroplatinate, and silicotungstate are insoluble. The insolubility of these compounds are used to extract francium from other radioactive products, such as zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, tin, antimony, the method mentioned in the section above. The CsFr molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. Francium superoxide (FrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium\u2013oxygen bonding. The relativistic destabilisation of the 6p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; spinor may make francium compounds in oxidation states higher than +1 possible, such as [Fr&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;\u2212&lt;/sup&gt;; but this has not been experimentally confirmed. Francium perchlorate is produced by the reaction of francium chloride and sodium perchlorate. The francium perchlorate coprecipitates with caesium perchlorate. This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and C. M. Nelson. However, this method is unreliable in separating thallium, which also coprecipitates with caesium. Francium perchlorate's entropy is expected to be 42.7\u00a0e.u (178.7 J mol&lt;sup&gt;\u22121&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;\u22121&lt;/sup&gt;).

In their second season of play, the 1923 Duncan Oilers again had the best record in the league, as the Oklahoma State expanded to eight teams. The Oilers ended the 1923 season with a record of 71\u201353, playing the season under manager Larry McLean. Duncan finished 2.0 games ahead the second place Cushing Refiners in the final standings. With the league again playing a split-season schedule, Duncan won the first-half title and met the Bristow Producers in the Final, where Bristow swept Duncan in four games. In their final season of play, the 1924 Duncan Oilers were in fifth place when the eight-team Oklahoma State League permanently folded following during the season. On July 8, 1924, the league \"suspended operations.\" The Oilers had a 33-37 record when the league folded.

A Mughal army commanded by the Mughal prince-heir Aurangzeb attempted to assault Daman, but was repulsed in the face of stubborn Portuguese resistance. \n\n## The siege\n\n After invading the territory of Daman, the Mughals set up their camp in \"Magravar\u00e1\", and from there dug trenches and siege works to approach Daman. All male Portuguese residents able to bear arms were called up for service, and engaged with the Mughals outside the walls in an attempt to keep them at bay. As reports reached Goa and neighbouring Portuguese garrisons of the siege, reinforcements were dispatched to Daman. The viceroy sent a detachment of troops under the command of the captain-major of the north Dom Braz de Castro, who upon arriving at Daman conducted a number of limited sallies against the Mughals outside the walls several times, though he was strictly forbidden on the viceroys orders. The defenders of Daman were later joined by reinforcements under the command of general Luiz de Mello e Sampayo, who ordered a general sally with all of his troops. The Portuguese managed to surprise the Mughals and capture the siege-works closest to the city, but were afterwards forced to withdraw back behind the city walls by the numerical superiority of the Mughals. General Sampayo and his son Diogo were both wounded in the action while covering the retreat of their men, and general Luiz de Mello Sampayo died two days later at Daman. He was replaced by captain-major Ant\u00f3nio Telles de Menezes. On the evening of January 5, 1639, an English ship transporting William Methwold, who had recently resigned the position of president of the English commerce in India called at Daman, and despite the siege, the Portuguese captain of the city offered Methwold a barrel of wine and other refreshments. Because the Mughals were unable to cut the naval supply lines to Daman, the Portuguese were able to continuously reinforce the city from the sea. Unable to break through Portuguese defenses despite mounting casualties, the Mughals requested peace through the governor of Surat Mir Musa, with the help of the president of the English East India Company factory at Surat, and later lifted the siege, having lost 700 to 7000 men in the action.", "Matt Logie": "Matt Logie (born September 10, 1980) is an American college basketball coach who is the current head coach of the Montana State Bobcats men's basketball team. \n\n## Playing career\n\n Logie played four years at Lehigh where he played and started in 114 games.

Their algorithm extends the Boyer-Moore majority finding algorithm in a significant way.  One version of the heavy-hitters problem is as follows: Given is a bag of elements and an integer . Find the values that occur more than times in . The Misra-Gries algorithm solves the problem by making two passes over the values in , while storing at most values from and their number of occurrences during the course of the algorithm. Misra-Gries is one of the earliest streaming algorithms, and it is described below in those terms in section #Summaries. \n\n## Misra\u2013Gries algorithm\n\n A bag is a like a set in which the same value may occur multiple times. Assume that a bag is available as an array of elements. In the abstract description of the algorithm, we treat  and its segments also as bags. Henceforth, a \"heavy hitter\" of bag is a value that occurs more than times in it, for some integer , . A \"-reduced bag\" for bag is derived from by repeating the following operation until no longer possible: Delete distinct elements from . From its definition, a -reduced bag contains fewer than different values. The following theorem is easy to prove: Theorem 1. Each heavy-hitter of is an element of a -reduced bag for . The first pass of the heavy-hitters computation constructs a -reduced bag . The second pass declares an element of to be a heavy-hitter if it occurs more than times in . According to Theorem 1, this procedure determines all and only the heavy-hitters. The second pass is easy to program, so we describe only the first pass. In order to construct , scan the values in in arbitrary order, for specificity the following algorithm scans them in the order of increasing indices. Invariant of the algorithm is that is a -reduced bag for the scanned values and is the number of distinct values in . Initially, no value has been scanned, is the empty bag, and is zero. Whenever element is scanned, in order to preserve the invariant: (1) if is not in , add it to and increase by 1, (2) if is in , add it to but don't modify , and (3) if becomes equal to , reduce by deleting distinct values from it and update appropriately.  algorithm Misra\u2013Gries is  1 = t, d := { }, 0;  for i from 0 to n-1 do  if b[i] t then  t, d:= t \u222a {b[i]}, d+1  else   endif  if d = k then  Delete distinct values from update   endif  endfor A possible implementation of is as a set of pairs of the form , ) where each is a distinct value in  and is the number of occurrences of in . Then is the size of this set. The step \"Delete distinct values from \" amounts to reducing each by 1 and then removing any pair (, ) from the set if becomes 0. Using an AVL tree implementation of , the algorithm has a running time of . In order to assess the space requirement, assume that the elements of  can have possible values, so the storage of a value needs  bits. Since each counter may have a value as high as , its storage needs bits. Therefore, for value-counter pairs,  the space requirement is . \n\n## Summaries\n\n In the field of streaming algorithms, the output of the Misra-Gries algorithm in the first pass may be called a \"summary\", and such summaries are used to solve the frequent elements problem in the data stream model. A streaming algorithm makes a small, bounded number of  passes over a list of data items called a \"stream\".

He is known for leading a penal expedition against the Montenegrin Drobnjaci tribe in 1812 and siding with the Sultan against the rebellious Bosnian ayans of Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 during the Bosnian uprising (1831\u20131832). \n\n## Biography\n\n Zulfikar Pasha was born in Miljevina near Fo\u010da. His father was Salih Alay-Bey and his grandfather was Zejnil Bey. He had sons D\u017eafer, Salih, Alija and Jusuf Bey. In 1811, Mustay Pasha of the Sanjak of Scutari organised an attack on Montenegro, directing his troops against the Piperi tribe. However, his campaign ended in defeat. The next year he ordered Zulfikar Pasha to attack the Montenegrin Drobnjaci tribe. One part of the Ottoman army was commanded by Smail Agha \u010cengi\u0107. Other Montenegrin tribes joined the Drobnjaci tribe. Although the Ottomans suffered heavy casualties, they managed to defeat the Montenegrins. The houses of the Drobnjaci tribe were destroyed, with many people being killed and hundreds enslaved. In 1813 he gained the title of pasha. Zulfikar Pasha fought against the Serb rebels during the First Serbian Uprising in 1813 and Had\u017ei-Prodan's rebellion in 1814. In 1814 he was appointed a muhafazah and a m\u00fctesellim in Valjevo. According to Hamdija Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107, Zulfikar Pasha served as the mutasarrif of Zvornik in 1825, while Safvet-beg Ba\u0161agi\u0107 writes that he served there in 1823. From 1828 to 1830 he was the m\u00fctesellim of Fo\u010da. When the Bosnian ayans headed by Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 rebelled against the Sultan in 1831, they expelled the Bosnian governor who moved to Herzegovina in September 1831. Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 proclaimed himself a vizier, which was met with refusal amongst the Herzegovinian magnates. They designated Zulfikar Pasha to report to Aga Pasha that they do not accept Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 as a vizier and ask the Sultan to appoint someone else. The Bosnian Muslims that opposed Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 largely fled to Serbia and Zulfikar Pasha was among them. In January 1832, he arrived in U\u017eice and Price Milo\u0161 asked the local authorities to take care of them. Serbia also opposed Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 and for this reason, they maintained contact with Zulfikar Pasha and other loyalist nobles. By May 1832, the loyalist forces were able to re-take the territory around the Drina river which marked the eastern borders of the Bosnia Eyalet with Serbia, and both sides prepared for the decisive battle. Zulfikar Pasha was appointed as the m\u00fctesellim of Fo\u010da and together with Osman Pasha Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 he was tasked with the reintroduction of Sultan's authority in the re-taken territory. After the loyalists won the war in 1833, Ali Pasha Rizvanbegovi\u0107, the leader of the loyalists, was named the head of the Herzegovina Eyalet which was exempted from the Bosnia Eyalet. Ali Pasha appointed his loyalists to important posts, including Zulfikar Pasha who was re-appointed as the m\u00fctesellim of Fo\u010da. By August 1838, however, the relations among the Herzegovinian magnates deteriorated. So much so, that Smail Agha and Zulfikar Pasha reported Ali Pasha's wrongdoings to the Sultan. Zulfikar Pasha died in Fo\u010da and was buried in the yard of the Alad\u017ea Mosque.", "One Night Lonely (video)": "One Night Lonely is a 2021 live video album from American country musician Mary Chapin Carpenter.

Petar was generally the public face of the gallery telling the Auckland Star, \u2018Jim and I believe in combining the best New Zealand painters in one gallery.\u2019 The initiative disturbed the New Zealand art world as Wellington art dealer Peter McLeavey remarked, \u2018the whole operation has rocked a few boats. He has the drive, charm and a quality of business that should make him a success.\u2019 McLeavey also noted of the clean, modern gallery space that there was \u2018no better private gallery in N.Z. or Australia.\u2019 The Petar/James Gallery closed in 1978. For the rest of the 1970s and into the 1980s, often using the Petar James Gallery brand, Petar Vuletic continued to mount exhibitions, sell art and consult for collectors and corporations, including the significant Fletcher Trust Collection. \n\n## Petar Vuletic\n\n Petar Vuletic, the director of the Petar/James Gallery, began collecting art while a law student and wrote about the abstract artist Milan Mrkusich in the student newspaper Craccum as early as 1968. Around the same time, he formed a close association with Mrkusich who encouraged him to become an art dealer.\u00a0 In 1972, as he was setting up the Petar/James Gallery, Petar Vuletic had worked with academic art historian Michael Dunn to organize the first major retrospective of Milan Mrkusich's work at the Auckland City Art Gallery. \n\n## Philosophy\n\n The Petar/James Gallery was founded on the conviction that the Nationalist painting of New Zealand was old fashioned. In an interview, Petar Vuletic described New Zealand painting as taking, \u2018a naive and simplistic view\u2026a concern for explicitly local subject matter such as things supposedly unique to the Zealand landscape, birds, pebbles, black singlets and harsh New Zealand light\u2019 This philosophy echoed the American critic Clement Greenberg who had visited\u00a0New Zealand in 1968 and had commented that, \u2018no one could expect New Zealand to turn out anything of any worth - not major art - because it was too far away from New York, Paris and London \u2026. the factor limiting artistic progress in New Zealand was that local artists did not get many chances to see major overseas work.\u2019 Petar Vuletic became the leading voice in arguing that the wider arts community needed to look beyond New Zealand for the future of art. This idea was strongly supported by his artists. \u2018Unfortunately, too much New Zealand art is not related to overseas trends, but to a preoccupation with the landscape.\u2019 Richard Killeen told a reporter in 1974. The Petar/James Gallery held regular Sunday meetings with Petar Vuletic encouraging younger artists like Richard Killeen, Ian Scott and Phillip O\u2019Sullivan to join senior artists like Milan Mrkusich and Gordon Walters and participate in discussions on the development of an internationalist perspective.\u00a0 \n\n## Exhibitions\n\n The Petar/James Gallery opened in June 1972 with a group show titled \"First Exhibition\" which included Don Driver, Rudolf Gopas, Richard Killeen, Milan Mrkusich, Philip Trusttum and Gordon Walters. Other key exhibitions included: 1972 \"American Graphics\" which included major American artists Robert Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers and James Rosenquist. The exhibition astutely preceded the 1973 exhibition \"Contemporary\" \"American\" \"Prints\" at the Auckland City Art Gallery. 1972 \"Milan Mrkusich: Meta Grey and Dark Paintings\". In this series Mrkusich removed all extraneous forms and presented what he later described as a \u2018specific surface\u2019. 1973 \"Ian Scott; Recent Paintings\".

It is considered endangered. It is sometimes condsidered a taxonomic synonym of \"Alopecurus magellanicus\". \n\n## Description\n\n Sonoma alopecurus is a perennial grass that grows up to 2.5 feet tall in wet soils and freshwater marshes. It flowers from May to July. \n\n## Distribution\n\n Though once found at sites across Sonoma and Marin Counties, it may no longer occur anywhere outside of Point Reyes. Much of its former wetland habitat has been destroyed or significantly altered for development and agriculture. Ecologists have attempted to expand its range via reintroductions without success. In Point Reyes, the main population is located in a marsh among the dunes on a parcel on the Point Reyes peninsula formerly owned by AT&amp;T.  \n\n## Population decline and restoration efforts\n\n The species was proposed to be endangered on August 2, 1995. It was listed as endangered on October 22, 1997. There is estimated to be as few as 1,000 extant plants. The decline of Sonoma alopecurus coincided with the end of cattle grazing in the region. Evidently, periodic grazing is beneficial to the survival of the species. Ecologists suspect it helps by reducing the abundance of adjacent plant species and giving the endangered grass more space to thrive. Initially, the Point Reyes National Seashore staff worked with ranchers to bring back prescribed grazing with the help of electric fencing around the area where the Sonoma alopecurus population occurs. The effort did not last long. Unstable soils, high winds, and cattle disturbance caused the fence to fall over, minimizing the effectiveness of grazing efforts. As a result, Point Reyes has worked to install a barbed wire fence along the wetland. In 2020, the park applied for and received a regional NPS block grant to finish the final 2,000 feet of fence construction. Completed that November, the fence allows Sonoma alopecurus habitat to be efficiently, intensively grazed during the winter when the grass is not flowering or setting seed.

During the Feudal era in Japanese history, the five Kiso trees were protected from cutting by common people and their cutting was reserved only for the residences and temples of the elite. Kiso timber was favored for government buildings and mansions of the \"daimyo\" during the Edo period. Shinto shrines were built largely with the unfinished wood of the five trees.  The Tokugawa Shogunate sought to restrict the abuse of construction timber. The Tokugawa-affiliated Bish\u00fb clan was one of three to own the Kiso forests; they restricted felling the forest's trees to their clan in 1665. In 1708, this restriction was revised to include the Hinoki cypress, the Sawara cypress, the umbrella-pine, and the hiba. The Japanese thuja was added to this protected group in 1718. This protection did not prevent the forests from being ruined. The punishment for cutting down a tree during the Edo period was decapitation. Restrictions on cutting the trees were lifted in the Meiji period. In modern times, the trees remain carefully protected.

It was one of the first word processors on the platform to offer a true what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) display, using GDOS to work with multiple fonts and embedded graphics. Most previous word processors on the platform were either entirely text-based, like Atari's own ST Writer, or did not use GDOS and did not support multiple fonts and effects on-screen. Overall, the program was relatively simple, similar to MacWrite. It did offer some more powerful features like the ability to generate a glossary and good control over typography. Reviews were generally positive, especially over its ability to easily perform layout and editing in rich documents, but the lack of a spell checker and the very slow printing was a notable concern in most reviews. \n\n## Description\n\n \n\n## GDOS\n\n The Graphics Environment Manager, or GEM, formed the basis of the Atari ST's graphical user interface (GUI). GEM included a system known as GDOS, short for Graphics Device Operating System, which was designed to virtualize graphics output in the same fashion that CP/Ms BDOS allowed different input/output devices to be virtualized. This meant that graphics generated for one device could be sent to any other GDOS device, for instance, from the screen to a printer. GDOS introduced significant overhead which noticeably effected the speed of all applications on the system, not just those using it. For performance reasons, few word processors on the ST made use of GDOS and instead called the underlying graphics routines directly. This meant they lacked the features like multiple fonts and WYSIWYG layout that would be seen on the Macintosh even in simple programs like MacWrite. Their GUIs were limited to issuing commands through the menu system and interaction using dialog boxes. Among the most popular word processors on the ST was Atari's own ST Writer, which took this to its extreme and removed any GUI at all, opening in a pure text mode and using control keys for all interaction. In all of these cases, output was performed by sending ASCII and printer control characters, such that output appeared in whatever modes the attached printer supported. \n\n## WordUp\n\n WordUp was among the few, and first, (commercial) programs that did make use of GDOS on the ST. This allowed it to make full use of the underlying GEM system, providing multiple fonts in a single document. Three standard GDOS fonts were included in the base package, Dutch and Swiss proportionally spaced fonts, and Courier (sometimes known as Typewriter), a monospaced font. Neocept also offered a companion program, Fontz, to modify these or create new ones. Typography offered fine control like how high superscripts should be and various forms of underlying and similar effects. The downside to offering these features was that performance was effected. Scrolling was notably slower than on non-GDOS programs, but was considered usable. Printing, which was performed as bitmap output, was significantly slower. They also offered an ASCII-only output for higher performance, which was useful for printing drafts. On a laser printer, output was considered excellent, and the program's manual was produced in this fashion. The program opened with a single window, but up to four documents could be opened at once. The windows contained a ruler across the top of the document showing margins and tabs. Below the document windows was a separate section showing the function key bindings and additional buttons for setting tabs. These are similar to the buttons seen in 1st Word Plus. It also included the ability to crop and resize images without leaving the program. It supported DEGAS, NEOchrome and GEM IMG files, automatically flowing text around them. The program did include a mail merge feature, but lacked a spell checker, which was considered a major oversight. Its glossary function was typically used more like a macro, allowing a short bit of text to be expanded out on command. Various layout settings could be saved to master pages, allowing a document to have several sections with different layouts and then easily reproduce those layouts in other areas. Other notable features were the powerful search and replace, which among other things allowed searches on styles, and a variety of easy ways to select sentences and paragraphs. The program also included a basic set of disk utility functions, including the ability to format a disk, check free space and delete or rename files. \n\n## Reception\n\n In the first issue of what was then \"ST/Amiga Format\", Ben Taylor reviewed a wide array of word processors on both the Atari ST and Amiga. WordUp received very high marks for every category, except performance which got 2 out of 5. He also points out that the quality of printing on common 9-pin printers was not very good, stating that \"if you use a laser printer, WordUp will produce excellent results... [but] at the moment it's a case of 'nice screen, shame about the print.'\" David Plotkin reviewed a number of word processors in the September 1988 edition of \"ST-Log\". He concludes that \"WordUp is not as fast as Word Writer, but the multiple faces/point sizes and ability to import graphics makes it ideal for writing which must include pictures. Be prepared for the very slow output.\" Plotkin wrote a second review dedicated to WordUp in the March 1989 edition. Its opening statement summarizes his entire review: \"WordUp is a powerful word processor for the Atari ST that utilizes GDOS to produce high-quality printed output, as well as multiple sizes and typefaces, both on the screen and in print. It has many features not found in other word processors in its price range, although it does not have all the features of WordPerfect.\" He notes a few missing features, like table of contents and index generation, and points out \"that the scrolling speed is quite slow. It is not so slow that it is unusable, but scrolling over long distances can be cumbersome.\" In a November 1990 comparison review, \"ST Format\" referred to WordUp as \"the cheapest and oldest of graphic output WPs\". They praised its simplicity and the end results when printed on a good printer, either a laser or 24-pin dot matrix printer. They complain about its slow scrolling, which made it hard to use on large documents, but conclude \"it's a fine, cheap WP for letters and reports.\" In spite of this mixed review, it receives a 79% overall rating. A major review in STart's May 1990 edition covered the release of Version 2.0. It opens by noting WordUp was \"the first word processor for the ST to marry text and graphics in a true WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) environment\" and then pointing out the improvements for 2.0 that included GEM metafiles (a vector graphics format), outdents, the ability to add accents to characters, and scaling fonts from the smaller set of sizes provided in the GDOS font files. But most importantly, \"overall speed has been significantly boosted\", support for 24-pin printers was added, and code improvements freed up 40\u00a0kB of RAM. He concludes, \"Overall, I am pleased with WordUp... and have no hesitation recommending the current version.\"", "UNFCCC COP 28/CMP 18/CMA 5": "", "Karubanga Jacob": "Karubanga Jacob Atenyi is a Ugandan politician born on October, 15, 1963 in Kabukye Cell Ward B, Kigumba Town Council, Kiryandongo district is the current Kibanda South County member of parliament and was formerly the Kigumba Town council mayor.

Throughout her childhood, she was heavily involved with the American Legion, both as a volunteer and as a service provider, as her father, Albert W. White, was a veteran. She was involved in local affairs and events related to the organization through both of her parents. White\u2019s family was of great significant in Woburn.

As well as that, she later enrolled in an art school in Harlem.  In 1932, White decided to go on a trip to the Soviet Union, in which Louise Patterson, Langston Hughes and Dorothy West went. The purpose of the trip was to make a film depicting the racial injustices of the United States, in a movie which would be called \u201cBlack and White\u201d. Nevertheless, due to outside demands and a lack of finance, the movie was never created or even made it to production. Even while it's unclear why White chose to go on the trip, her interactions with activists like Langston Hughes may have had an impact. White aimed to raise awareness of the racial injustice that were taking place in the United States. Growing up in Boston with Dorothy West and taking part in the Harlem Renaissance social scene in New York gave White her first link to the group that embarked on the trip.  Constance White is well-depicted in Hassan's biography from 2015 of attorney Loren Miller, who traveled to the Soviet Union. \n\n## Personal life\n\n According to Hassan\u2019s biography, Constance was described as a lesbian, who had a female partner on the trip, Sylvia Garner.

It is located in the village of M\u00f8sstrond. It is one of the churches for the Rauland parish which is part of the \u00d8vre Telemark prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in 1923 using plans drawn up by the architect Olav O. Bitust\u00f8yl. The church seats about 100 people. \n\n## History\n\n The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1598, but that was not the year the church was built. There is historical evidence of a medieval church at Hovden (now referred to as M\u00f8sstrond), but very little is known about the old church. At some point, however, the church was closed and there are no traces of the old building, nor is the exact site of the old church known. In 1849, a new church was built at Hovden, possibly on the same site as the medieval building. Not much is recorded about that building. In 1903, the nearby lake M\u00f8svatn was dammed and this led to the rising of the water levels on the lake. The church had originally been built on a peninsula, but after the rising of the water, now it is located on a small island. The church serves the people in the village of M\u00f8sstrond on the island as well as the rural areas surrounding the lake (many of those areas are not connected to the national road network and are only accessible by boat). The church was struck by lightning in the summer of 1919 and burned to the ground. Olav O. Bitust\u00f8yl was hired to design the new church. The new church was completed and consecrated in 1923. It is a wooden long church with a west tower that is drawn slightly into the nave. The choir is on the east side of the nave and it is flanked by two small sacristies.", "Mummucipes": "Mummucipes is a monotypic genus of mummuciid camel spiders, first described by Carl Friedrich Roewer in 1934.

She is Research Leader at the Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm, Sweden. Her art intersects with political and social organizing, especially by women, and includes many collaborations with existing organizations. \n\n## Art career\n\n Bauer's artwork is grounded in feminist theory and engages with issues including immigration, colonialism, and the history of women's efforts to organize themselves and their communities within the art world and beyond. Her research has engaged with the history of radical filmmaking, notably The Berwick Street Film Collective, Cinema Action and The London Women's Film Group; this has resulted in filmmaking collaborations with the Southall Black Sisters, a London-based group that organizes against violence and discrimination towards women. Her 2016 film \"Workers!\", with SCOT-PEP, documents the labor concerns of sex workers as they occupy and infiltrate space of the Scottish Trade Union Congress. The 2003 film \"Der Fall Joseph\" (The Case of Joseph) reflected on the death of an immigrant child in Germany, and surrounding narratives of discrimination, fascism, false testimony, and the right to have a death investigated. In 2008, Bauer worked with artist Annette Krauss to produce \"Read the Masks, Tradition Is Not Given,\" an installation and planned demonstration at Van Abbemuseum. This piece criticized the black face Zwarte Piet tradition in the Netherlands. Their planned program was cancelled due to death threats.

Rahman is known for his focus on sustainable and ethically produced garments and is the first Bangladeshi fashion designer in history to showcase their work at London Fashion Week. \n\n## Early life\n\n Rahman was born and raised in Tower Hamlets, London. Rahman's father worked as a tailor in the rag trade, the immigrant-run clothing manufacturing business that provides cheap labour for the fashion industry. Rahman's work is heavily influenced by his Bengali heritage and the city in which he grew up. \n\n## Career\n\n Rahman graduated from Central Saint Martins School of Art &amp; Design, London, alongside fellow London-based designers Richard Malone and A Sai Ta. In 2019, he presented his first London Fashion Week collection entitled 'For the people who dream in colour' that aimed to reinterpret and re-tell stories of South Asian identity. Drawing inspiration from his family's photographs, his father's love of traditional British tailoring, and his mother's love of clothing from her homeland, Rahman's collection blended Western and South Asian elements, reflecting the cultural duality of his own family and their connection to the rag trade. Rahman drew inspiration from 1990s family photos for his colour palette and used natural dyes and traditional Bangladeshi printing techniques, inspired by the Khadi prints found in the V&amp;A, to create his garments. The clothing, made from cotton, wool, and silk, was tailored with attention to detail, featuring shirts and jackets with a graceful taper at the armpit. Block prints were created in collaboration with artisans at Aranya, a fairtrade enterprise in Dhaka, Bangladesh using natural dyes. Rahman included South Asian representation in the presentation of his collection. He held the event at Brady Arts and Community Centre where he regularly teaches and exclusively featured South Asian models. His aim was to include a diverse range of backgrounds within the South Asian community, including Sikh, Muslim, Hindu, Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi individuals, and stressed the importance of recognising the distinct cultural differences within the community. In 2020, he showcased his second collection 'Children of the rag trade', dedicating the collection to his father who worked as a tailor in the rag trade. One suit from this collection was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London for their 'Fashioning Masculinities' 2022 exhibition, making Rahman the first British-Bengali fashion designer in history to have their work featured in a V&amp;A exhibition. In addition to his work in fashion, Rahman is also an accomplished artist, working in a variety of media including print, installation and sculpture. His art often explores themes of identity and cultural exchange, and has been exhibited in galleries around the world such as the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and Museum of the Home. 'My Home, My Bari' is a community project led by Rahman. First exhibited in 2021 at the Kobi Nazrul Centre in the heart of Banglatown, London, 'My Home, My Bari' offered a glimpse into life of Bangladeshi community living around 1970's Brick Lane and showcased the work and legacy of the local business owners from the British-Bangladeshi community and artistic outcomes of the nine-month participatory project with young Bangladeshi artists. The project was first commissioned by Tower Hamlets Council to create a collaborative and singular installation marking the 50th anniversary of the Independence of Bangladesh. In an article written about the project by Tower Hamlets Council, Rahman said \u201cThe project also recognises the importance of events which took place in 1971 but takes a step back to re-examine the era and bring it closer to home through the multi-layered connections and cultural connotations of the safe and familiar space of \u2018home\u2019.\u201d In 2022, the second iteration of 'My Home, My Bari' was comissioned by Museum of the Home, London (previously know as 'the Geffrye Museum'), and saw Rahman continue the narrative with seven young British-Bangladeshi Muslim artists. The second iteration aimed to document the un-told stories of the Bengali women in the young artist's lives. 'Begum', a collaborative documentary-film told these stories. \n\n## Advocacy\n\n As a member of the Bengali diaspora, Rahman is deeply committed to preserving and promoting his cultural heritage, and reimagining how queer creatives in the South Asian community are perceived. He is also an active member of the London art and fashion scenes, and is known for his collaborative spirit and dedication to mentoring emerging Muslim talents. In the 2022 Evening Standard article \u2018Fashion cares more about billionaire bile than those on the breadline: Fashion academics react to Kanye West', Rahman stated \u201cWhen we talk about the intersections of black identity within fashion, Kanye West will always be in that mix. His viewpoint; whether it is satire, whether it is serious political alignment, has to be discussed from the viewpoint of allowing different perspectives of the black experience to be documented in history. However problematic it is. Now whether we engage with it or not, is for me, truly the question we should be asking.\u201d Rahman has spoken out about the lack of South Asian representation within the fashion supply chain", "Qin Yaqing": "Qin Yaqing (born October 1953) is a Chinese political scientist and a constructivist international relations theorist.

One is that King Gyeongmun slept comfortably only when snakes stuck out their tongues and covered his chest whenever he slept, the other is that the king's ears are donkey ears. \n\n## Plot\n\n It is also called \u2018the king\u2019s ears are donkey ears\u2019, \u2018King Gyeongmun\u2019s ears\u2019, and \u2018Yeoiseolhwa (\uc5ec\uc774\uc124\ud654, \u9a62\u8033\u8aaa\u8a71)\u2019. This story is included in the part for the 48th Gyeongmun Daewang Dynasty of the \"Samguk Yusa(\u4e09\u570b\u907a\u4e8b)\" Volume 2, Records of Great Wonders Part 2 (\uad8c2 \uae30\uc774(\u7d00\u7570) \uc81c2). This part has three stories: the story of 'The King with donkey ears' , \u2018Eungryeom (\uc751\ub834, \u81ba\u5ec9) who became king with three good things\u2019 and \u2018the king who sleeps with snakes\u2019. After King Gyeongmun ascended the throne, his ears suddenly grew longer and became like the ears of a donkey. No one knew about it. Even the empress and the court ladies didn't know about it. Only one, the king's 'bokdujangi' ( (\u5e5e\u982d\uc7a5\uc774), a person who used to make or repair bokdu worn by kings or government officials on their head, knew it. He did not dare to reveal the fact all his life, but when he died, he went into the bamboo grove of Dorimsa (\ub3c4\ub9bc\uc0ac, \u9053\u6797\u5bfa) which is a temple which used to exist in Gyeongju. Then he shouted at a bamboo tree, \"Our king's ears are like donkey ears.\" After that, when the wind blew, a sound came from the bamboo field, saying, \"Our king's ears are like donkey ears.\" The king did not like this, so he cut down the bamboo and planted cornus officinalis, but the sound was still the same. \n\n## Analysis\n\n It can be understood that it reflects the political burden of King Gyeongmun, who pursued the strengthening of royal authority while pacifying the resistance of the aristocrats, and the confused social image of uneasy public sentiment. \n\n## Characteristics\n\n This story has been widely orally handed down due to its rich folklore, and has been a subject of research by domestic and foreign scholars from an early age in that its distribution area is not only domestic but also global. Aarne-Thompson's \"Midas and the Ass's Ears\" basically consists of 'a man with donkey ears', 'a secret physical singularity discovered by a barber', 'a shamanic reed reveals a secret.' The oldest record of this story is by Aristophanes, in Ovidius' Metamorphoses, which relates Midas, king of Phrygia in Asia Minor. Midas' ears are donkey ears which is the same as in Korea. However, it also appears as horse or goat ears in regions such as France, Romania, Russia, Greece, Ireland, and Chile. On the other hand, it is a little different that our 'dresser (\ubcf5\ub450\uc7a5\uc774)' is 'barber' in the story of King Midas, and 'bamboo' is 'reed'. It has been confirmed that this tale exists not only in Korea but also in India, Mongolia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan, showing considerable differences in terms of content, but common in that the main characters all have donkey ears. Considering the geographical and political conditions, it is possible that this type of tale exists in China and Japan, but it has not yet been confirmed. A work that modernized this tale is 'Gwi' by Bang Gi-hwan, published in the November issue of Munhakyesul (\ubb38\ud559\uc608\uc220, \u6587\u5b78\u85dd\u8853, Literature and Art) in 1957.", "Ceretto": "Ceretto may refer to:", "Ghosts of the Forest (album)": "Ghosts of the Forest is the debut album by the band of the same name, a side project lead by Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio. The album was released on April 12, 2019 on vinyl and streaming services only. Musicians joining Anastasio on the album include Phish drummer Jon Fishman and Trey Anastasio Band bassist Tony Markellis in his last studio collaboration with Anastasio before his death in 2021. \n\n## Background\n\n The \"Ghosts of the Forest\" name refers to three different entities: the album, which features nine songs, the project as a whole, which features the material on the album plus an additional eleven songs only performed live, and the group itself. Ghosts of the Forest was partially conceived as a tribute to Anastasio's friend Chris Cottrell, who died of adrenal cancer in January of 2018. While the group's live performances share the extended improvisations that define Phish concerts, Ghosts of the Forest's performances differ from Anastasio's other projects in that the group's setlists remained static throughout its run. The Ghosts in the Forest project was also a main focus of the documentary \"Between Me and My Mind\", released the same year. Anastasio used a stripped-back approach to his playing for the album and employed minimal overdubs, citing Cottrell as an influence for this decision. He stated: Nature also plays a central role in the sound of the album, with Anastasio and mixer Vance Powell at one point recording 45 minutes of ambient outside sounds, elements of which were later overlaid onto the album's songs. All songs on the album besides \"In Long Lines\" and \"Brief Time\" have made it into Phish setlists. Additionally, another Ghosts of the Forest song, \"A Life Beyond the Dream\", appears on their 2020 studio album \"Sigma Oasis\". \n\n## Commercial performance\n\n \"Ghosts of the Forest\" made the top ten of the \"Billboard\" Vinyl Albums chart, reaching number four.

Concluding Kiang wrote, \"The film ambles onward, it reveals its arcs of change not in dramatic showdowns or sudden revelations, but in ellipses, in the occasional mysterious fold in chronology and, most rewardingly, in the casual, unforced repetition of certain motifs.\" David Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" calling the film a contemplative film of quiet rewards, stated, \"Piao Songri\u2019s loose, fluid camerawork trails the protagonist, played with soulful intelligence by Xin, there\u2019s both a haunting sense of all that he\u2019s lost and a newfound self-knowledge that perhaps might propel him forward with greater openness.\" Lee Marshall for ScreenDaily wrote in review that \"The film\u2019s delicacy of touch comes through not only in the bittersweet love story at its centre, but in a wealth of seemingly marginal details.\"", "Joan Didion bibliography": "List of works by or about the American writer Joan Didion.", "Attilio Di Napoli": "Attilio Di Napoli (Melfi, 4 June 1883 \u2013 2 December 1953) was an Italian politician, leader of the Italian Socialist Party in Lucania in the early 20th century. He was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the early 1920s, and after being persecuted under the Fascist regime, he became Minister of Industry, Commerce and Labour of the Badoglio II Cabinet. \n\n## Biography\n\n He was born in Melfi on 4 June 1883, into a middle-class family, and after graduating in law he joined the Italian Socialist Party in the early 1900s, soon becoming its leader in his hometown, as well as secretary of the Peasants' League and of the local Socialist circle. He founded and directed the weekly magazine \"Il Lavoratore\", and often sent political news from Melfi to the \"Avanti!\", keeping a close correspondence with Enrico Ferri and Ettore Ciccotti. He was a very active organizer and lecturer, and often held anti-clerical speeches; in 1911\u20131912 he was one of the leaders of the protest against the Italo-Turkish War in Basilicata, organizing rallies and processions against the war and the increase of food prices, and in support of disarmament and universal suffrage. In 1913, before the political elections, a consistent peasants' movement developed in Basilicata, and Di Napoli was elected mayor of Melfi. In the following years he was one of the leaders of the peasants' movement, campaigning for wage increases, reduced working hours and collective land lease contracts without the mediation of sub-licensors. In 1914 he was elected to the provincial council of Potenza; on 24 May of the same year the prefect of Potenza described him in a confidential note as \"a very turbulent element who has acquired a dangerous influence on the masses\". After the outbreak of the First World War he was an outspoken advocate of Italy's neutrality, and continued to campaign for peace even after Italy's entry into the war, which led to \"Il Lavoratore\" being suspended by the government in 1917 (the reason given being \"With the publication of this magazine it was proposed to depress the public spirit in the current political moment, also favoring the peace proposals of the central empires\"). In 1919, after the end of the war, Di Napoli was at the head of the unrest against the increase in food prices in the Melfi area. In January 1921, at the XVII Congress of the Italian Socialist Party (which would result in the split-up of the hardliner faction, which gave birth to the Italian Communist Party), he attacked the Communist fraction, stating that their split-up would result in the weakening of the workers' movement, and that their insistence on revolutionary violence would have done nothing but plunge more people into hunger and in misery. In the same year he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies with the Italian Socialist Party. Following the advent of Fascism, Di Napoli was repeatedly targeted by squadrist violence; in 1924, after the end of his term as a deputy, he was prevented from returning from Rome to Melfi, and on 20 May 1927 the Provincial Commission of Potenza ordered his arrest and confinement, but he appealed the decision and it was revoked and replaced by a cease and desist order. During the twenty years of the Fascist regime he was kept under close scrutiny by the police; he was able to resume his political activities after the fall of Fascism in 1943, and in 1944 he was appointed Minister of Industry and Commerce in the second Badoglio cabinet. He was later made a member of the High Court of Justice for the sanctions against Fascism. In 1945 he entered the National Council, where he became part of the Foreign Affairs Commission.

Kinnier, as the first newspaper in Reading. By July 1727, the ownership of the paper had been transferred to William Ayres. By 1737, William Carnan appeared on the in-print of the paper. Carnan died late that same year, after which he was succeeded by his brother and widow; she later married John Newbery, who then partly held ownership over the \"Ready Mercury\".

It spans the River Sherbourne and its flat valley as it passes through Spon End, a suburb just to the west of Coventry city centre. Construction started in 1848 and the line opened in 1850. The viaduct is a quarter of a mile (0.4 kilometres) long and consists of 28 arches, each with a span. In 1857, 23 of the arches collapsed. The collapse was blamed on shoddy workmanship and poor quality materials. The collapsed section was rebuilt but the line was not able to reopen until October 1860. Not all of the viaduct was rebuilt, as part of the original viaduct was deemed to be good enough to be reused. An act of parliament had to be sought to authorise the reconstruction works. In the meantime, Coundon Road became the temporary terminus of the line. The stone for the original arches may have been from a lineside quarry near Coundon Road station, which is just north of the viaduct. The rebuilt arches were in blue engineering brick and joined on to the remaining stone arches. The height and width of the arches make the viaduct a prominent local landmark. It is on Coventry City Council's register of locally listed buildings and forms part of the Spon End conservation area, which was declared in 2003.

Released on October 8, 2021 as a single, the song is about the heartbreak of a broken romantic relationship that was ended in the city of Tuscaloosa, Alabama that Smith had experienced, comparing it to the Third Saturday in October college football rivalry. The song would later go viral within the college football fanbase, gaining millions of streams on social media platforms. \n\n## Background and production\n\n According to Smith, the song was written as a song written towards his ex-girlfriend who he had broken up with. Although the song had numerous references to college football, Smith wrote that the song was not about college football, but rather as a \"heartbreak song\" centered around college football. In later interviews, he would praise the state of Alabama, saying You know how you love a song, but it reminds you of your ex? That\u2019s what this song is about. And that\u2019s what I love about it. It\u2019s a compliment to Alabama.\" Production for the song started when friend of Smith, Hunter Philips sent over a demo of the song to Smith. Smith, along with his producer immediately wanted to release the song with the help of a music label, saying that \"this song is pretty special.\" Smith had trouble finding a label to sign for the song, so he released a music video for the song, shot by Smith's brother on Instagram. The video received one million views within the first day of release. Once the music video released, owner of Big Machine Records, Scott Borchetta called Smith and said that he was interested in releasing the song on October 8, 2021 under the Valory Music Co. name. \n\n## Composition\n\n The song makes heavy references to the Third Saturday in October college football rivalry between the Tennessee Volunteers and the Alabama Crimson Tide. At the time of the song's release, Alabama had beaten Tennessee for 15 straight years since 2006. Smith, who is a Tennessee Volunteers fan, wanted to tie the rivalry together with the pain of breaking up with his girlfriend within the city of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where the University of Alabama is located. \n\n## Critical reception\n\n Paul Finebaum, sportscaster for ESPN's SEC Network, wrote that he thought the song was \"cute\", but would not garner attention or hatred from Alabama Crimson Tide fans, saying that \"Alabama fans don't really care about anybody else anymore... Alabama doesn't concern itself with others.\" He wrote that due to Alabama's consistency of winning most of their football games, it has led to an increase for hatred for the team by opposing fans and an increase of an overall lack of care from Alabama fans. \n\n## Within college football\n\n Within the Alabama Crimson Tide fanbase, the song has seen divided responses according to Smith. Smith has said that he has seen some criticize and not like the song, saying that Smith is jealous of their football team. Smith has also said that some Alabama fans had also seen the compliments made towards Alabama as a whole. The song has seen increased usage when the Alabama Crimson Tide loses, which is seen as a rare occasion by college football fans due to the reputation of Alabama usually winning most, if not all of their football games in a given season. After the 2022 College Football Playoff National Championship, where the Georgia Bulldogs beat the Alabama Crimson Tide to win the national championship, Smith reported that streams for the song had doubled after the victory.", "Ulsan Bridge": "Ulsan Bridge (Hangul: \uc6b8\uc0b0\ub300\uad50) is a suspension bridge in the south coast of South Korea.

Thousands of Greenlandic Inuit girls and women had intrauterine devices placed, often without their consent, under the direction of Danish government officials. The program was created to control Greenland's birth rate. Greenlandic politician Aki-Matilda H\u00f8egh-Dam has described the practice as genocide. In 2022, the Danish and Greenlandic governments agreed to hold a two-year investigation into the campaign. \n\n## Involuntary fertility control program\n\n Between around 1966 and 1975, thousands of Greenlandic Inuit girls and women had intrauterine devices (IUDs) inserted to control their pregnancies under the direction of the Danish government. Half of the 9,000 women in Greenland who could have children were given IUDs in the first five years of the program; in many cases, women (and in the case of girls, their parents) did not consent to the procedure. For instance, Naja Lyberth was 13 or 14 years old, Elisib\u00e1nguak' Jeremiasssen was 13, and Arnannguaq Poulsen was 16 and staying in Denmark when she received hers. All of the girls in Lyberth's class were told to have IUDs placed by a visiting doctor and then taken to a hospital for them to be inserted. The purpose of the campaign was to lower the birth rate in Greenland. Thousands of girls and women ultimately had IUDs placed without their consent during the campaign. Portions of the campaign were unlawful. In Greenland, it was illegal for doctors to give girls contraception without their parental consent until 1970; past 1970, it was against the law for doctors to place IUDs in girls, like Lybert, who were under 15 and had never been pregnant. Greenland only received autonomy in its healthcare in 1991. \n\n## Investigations and reaction\n\n In 2017, Lyberth was among the first people to publicly discuss the spiral campaign; she wrote on Facebook about her experiences. In 2022, the podcast (\"Spiral Campaign\"), hosted by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, uncovered the campaign's records. Following the podcast's release that year, politicians and human rights organizations began calling for investigations; the party Naleraq wrote legislation to investigate. On 2 June, the Inatsisartut (Greenlandic parliament) voted to demand that the Danish government investigate the history of the campaign. Later that year, the Danish and Greenlandic governments agreed to begin a two-year investigation. It seeks to document the background of the birth control campaign; its implementation, including Greenlandic government involvement; the reasons the campaign began and continued; and other fertility control programs until 1991. The Inuit Ataqatigiit Minister of Health, Mimi Karlsen, asked women impacted by the fertility control program to call Tusaannga, a social services and support hotline. Aki-Matilda H\u00f8egh-Dam, a Siumut member of the Folketing (Danish parliament) called the campaign genocide. She stated that in the Danish desire to modernise Greenland, elevating the material conditions of its residents was too expensive, so the government instituted a program to genocide the population. Danish lawyer Mads Pramming likened the case to the Little Danes experiment, a 1951 Danish operation that resettled 22 Greenlandic children in Denmark. Lyberth said in 2022 that the campaign \"stole\" her virginity, caused her pain, may have caused complications for her later in life, and continued to traumatise her into adulthood. Despite this, some activists have criticised the limited scope of the campaign. In December 2022, BBC News noted that numerous women and girls allege that this campaign continued after 1991. Greenland's minister of health Mimi Karlsen told the BBC she would forward their allegations to the Greenlandic medical authorities to see if they are true and if they reflect widespread practises related to the spiral case.", "Giulia Perotti": "Giulia Perotti (born 29 August 2009) is an Italian artistic gymnast.

Donald Petrie described the species \"M. goyenii\" in 1891. Plants of this subspecies of forget-me-not are perennial rosettes which form loose clumps, with ebracteate, erect inflorescences, and white corollas with partly exserted stamens.  \n\n## Taxonomy and etymology\n\n \"Myosotis goyenii\" Petrie subsp. \"goyenii\" is in the plant family Boraginaceae. The species \"M. goyenii\" was described by Donald Petrie in 1891.  Multiple specimens of original material (syntypes) of \"Myosotis goyenii\" were collected in different localities in Otago, New Zealand by Peter Goyen (from Arrowtown) and Donald Petrie (from the Cardrona Valley and Lake Hawea). The lectotype was designated by Carlos Lehnebach, and is lodged at the herbarium of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (WELT SP002484). Donald Petrie gave this species the specific epithet, \"goyenii\", to honor his friend, Peter Goyen (1845\u20131927), who collected several specimens of \"M. goyenii.\" Like Petrie himself, Goyen was a school inspector and naturalist who lived on the South Island of New Zealand. This is one of two subspecies recognized in \"Myosotis goyenii\"; the other is \"M. goyenii\" subsp. \"infima\"\".\" The subspecies are allopatric, with \"M. goyenii\" subsp. \"goyenii\" occupying schist substrates in Southland and Otago, and \"M. goyenii\" subsp. \"infima\" found on limestone and calcareous substrates in Marlborough and Canterbury. \"Myosotis goyenii\" subsp. \"goyenii\" can be distinguished from \"M. goyenii\" subsp. \"infima\" by its clumps of single rosettes that have a central woody taproot, and the following floral characteristics: a long style (&gt; 6 mm), pistil that is 1.6\u20132.8\u00d7 longer than the calyx, filaments attached &lt; 1 mm below the scales, and anthers only partly included (with the tips equal to or just surpassing the scales). By contrast, \"M. goyenii\" subsp. \"infima\" plants form caespitose clumps of multiple rosettes that have fibrous roots, and have flowers with a short style (&lt; 6 mm), pistil that is &lt; 1.5\u00d7 longer than the calyx, filaments attached &gt; 1 mm below the faucal scales, and anthers fully included. \n\n## Phylogeny\n\n \"Myosotis goyenii\" was shown to be a part of the monophyletic southern hemisphere lineage of \"Myosotis\" in phylogenetic analyses of standard DNA sequencing markers (nuclear ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA regions). Within the southern hemisphere lineage, species relationships were not well resolved. \"Myosotis goyenii\" subsp. \"goyenii\" was included in one previous phylogenetic study. Of the three sequenced individuals of \"M. goyenii,\" the two from Otago (\"M. goyenii\" subsp. \"goyenii\") grouped with each other and with \"M. albosericea\" in the nuclear ribosomal DNA analyses, and with \"M. australis\" and other species in the chloroplast DNA analyses.  \n\n## Description\n\n \"Myosotis goyenii\" subsp. \"goyenii\" plants have long woody, branched taproots, and are single rosettes that often grow together to form loose clumps. The rosette leaves have petioles 10\u201348 mm long. The rosette leaf blades are 7\u201340 mm long by 3\u201311 mm wide (length: width ratio 2.2\u20135.3: 1), usually narrowly oblanceolate, oblanceolate or narrowly obovate, widest at or above the middle (rarely below the middle), with an acute apex (rarely obtuse). Both surfaces and the edges of the leaf are densely covered in straight, appressed, antrorse (forward-facing) hairs that are oriented parallel to the mid vein. Each rosette has 2\u201340 erect, usually once-branched (sometimes unbranched), ebracteate inflorescences that are up to 350 mm long and are usually bifurcating in an open, forked 'V' shape near the tips. The cauline leaves are up to 13 per inflorescence and are similar to the rosette leaves but smaller with shorter petioles, and decrease in size toward the tip. Each inflorescence has up to 26 flowers, each borne on a pedicel up to 1.3 mm long at fruiting, and each without a bract. The calyx is 3\u20135 mm long at flowering and 4\u20136 mm long at fruiting, lobed to half to almost all of its length, and densely covered in antrorse, straight to flexuous, appressed to patent hairs. The corolla is white, up to 14 mm in diameter, with a cylindrical tube, petals that are broadly ovate, obovate, broadly obovate or broadly obovate, and small yellow scales alternating with the petals. The stamens are 6.1\u20137.5 mm long (measured from the base of the calyx to the anther tips) with filaments 0.3\u20130.4 mm long that are attached to the corolla tube &lt; 1 mm below the base of the scales. The anthers are partly exserted above the scales, with the anther tips equal to or just surpassing the scales. The pistil is 8\u201311 mm long with a style that is 7\u201310 mm long at fruiting. The four smooth, shiny, light to dark brown nutlets are 1.7\u20132.7 mm long by 1.0\u20131.3 mm wide and narrowly ovoid in shape. The chromosome number of \"M. goyenii\" subsp. \"goyenii\" is unknown. The pollen of \"M. goyenii\" subsp. \"goyenii\" is unknown. It flowers and fruits from November\u2013March, with the main flowering and fruiting period from December\u2013February. \n\n## Distribution and habitat\n\n \"Myosotis goyenii\" subsp. \"goyenii\" is a forget-me-not endemic to Otago and Southland in the South Island of New Zealand, from 650\u20131300 m ASL.

The club plays its home games at Homefields in Boxford, which has a small clubhouse which doubles for a cricket pavilion in the summer for Edwardstone Cricket Club. \n\n## History\n\n Club football in Boxford dates back to at least 1919. The original ground was Rectory Park, where houses have now been built. Rectory Park was used until the current Homefield ground was bought by the village in the late Sixties from Ipswich brewers Tolly Cobbold for \u00a3160. Boxford Youth FC played at Homefield from 1974, started by Gordon Atkinson. Its successor, Boxford Rovers Youth FC, came into existence in 1977, with Gordon as manager, when the players wanted to play in a competitive league. The team played in the U12 section of the Suffolk and Essex Sunday Youth Football Combination. Footballing glamour came calling in April 1979, when the team toured to the US, visiting New York and Boxford, Massachusetts for two weeks. The whole squad of 15 boys, accompanied by four of their fathers, made the trip, and were looked after by families in Massapequa, Long Island and Boxford, Massachusetts. The following year, the Massapequa boys came to Boxford for a return visit. \n\n## Youth football\n\n Throughout the majority of the 1980s and 1990s, Boxford Rovers Youth Football Club played matches in the Colchester Youth Football League and more recently (2000s/2010s) the youth teams have moved to the Ipswich &amp; Suffolk Youth Football League or the Suffolk Youth Football League.

However, it wasn't until the 1999/2000 season that the club finally made a foray into Sunday league football as part of the Sudbury Sunday Football League (which merged into The Treadfirst Sudbury &amp; Haverhill District Sunday Football League in the mid 2000s). After four successful seasons with straight promotions, Boxford Rovers joined the Colchester &amp; East Essex Football League (now sadly defunct) and played Saturday football, again earning four promotions. They were elected in the Suffolk and Ipswich League Division Three in 2010 and earned another promotion to Division Two. However, in 2014/15 the club was forced to fold following a slump in local footballers looking for Saturday football.  \n\n## Renaissance\n\n The club reformed in April 2022, initially playing home games at Webb's Meadow in Nayland - behind Nayland Village Hall. But, after discussions with the Essex and Suffolk Border League, the club was allowed to move back to Homefields in November 2022 and started an appeal to upgrade facilities.

They seem to be arranged with deliberate intent to confuse. They're unclear and ambiguous, do not explain any of the mechanisms sufficiently, are written in simple language when complex terminology is necessary, and complicated language with directness is necessary.\" On the other hand, Costikyan liked a number of innovations in rules, including the supply system and the varying quality of units available to both sides as the game progresses. He concluded, \"All in all, \"East Front\" is not a bad game. It contains a number of intriguing innovations that I'd like to see developed in further games, and the graphics are good. Although the rules seem to have been written by the chimpanzee-and-typewriter method, with a bit of thought and experimentation they can be puzzled out. [...] The game is definitely worth getting, unless you have a phobia about east front games.\" In \"The Guide to Simulations/Games for Education and Training\", Martin Campion commented on this game's usefulness as an educational aid, saying, \"This is a splendid simulation and a valuable compromise between the abstraction of \"\" and the excessive detail of \"War in the East\".

In New York Sheppard met the label owners, Hank Medress and the Tokens, and ended up doing some studio work for them. In late 1967, he helped his brother Michael Ship, a member of the Scene, to get a one-off single deal.

In the past its height was over 60, but it decreased because the dune is steadily moving eastwards and discharging its sands into the Curonian lagoon, prominently at the under the wind-induced saltation. \n\n## Ecology\n\n Based on the dune, the Parnidis Landscape Reserve was created within the Curonian Spit National Park to preserve a unique natural dune landscape, some of which are bare, and some forested, as well as the coastal areas of the dunes at both the Baltic Sea and the Curonian Lagoon. It is the only place with drifting dunes in the National Park.  The Parnidis dune is almost bare, but there are many patches of vegetative habitats, which are subject to degradation due to natural and anthropogenic reasons. For example the sand blown from the peaks of the dune slides down the slope and destroys the vegetation. The same effect is from rain washouts. Also people climbing the dune in non-prescribed places disturb the sand, with the same consequences. \n\n## Tourism\n\n The Parnidis Dune is one of the main tourist attractions of the Curonian Spit National Park. A scenic viewpoint, Parnidis Dune Observation Deck, was constructed at the highest location on the dune, from which you can see both the sea and the lagoon. Due to the fragility of the moving sand, the visitors' tracks were constructed and certain areas are specifically marked where walking is prohibited. , experts estimated the allowable recreational limit to be 25 dune visitors per square meter in half a day. \n\n## Sundial\n\n By the observation deck there is a large granite sundial built in 1995 on the top of the dune. The sundial is around a stone pillar high. It also includes small steps covered with granite slabs, carved with hour and half-hour notches, as well as one notch for each month, and four additional notches for solstices and equinoxes.

She competed in the 1937 24 Hours of Le Mans and set a new woman's record at Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb in a 2-litre Alta in 1939. Stanley-Turner served ten years in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force as an Assistant Section Officer. \n\n## Biography\n\n Stanley-Turner was born the only daughter among half-brothers on 12 November 1916 and was taught at a number of schools in England as well as overseas. This was because her father was a RAF Medical Services doctor during his foreign postings and her mother served in the Haslar Naval Hospital. Stanley-Turner did not take up feminine hobbies and raced cars at the amateur level from a young age and was taught to drive by her father and woman competition driver Joan Chetwynd. She for the most part drove MG Cars through her father being friends with some racing drivers as well as the MG Car Company managing director Cecil Kimber. In 1937, Stanley-Turner competed in her first major race, the First Easter Mountain Handicap, at Brooklands in a J-type MG Midget car, and retired from the Rallye Paris \u2013 Saint-Rapha\u00ebl F\u00e9minin. She entered the 1937 24 Hours of Le Mans with the British-based G. E. T. Eyston squad that fielded the 54 MG Midget PB car she shared with Joan Riddell. The duo finished sixteenth overall and fourth in the S1.1 class. Stanley-Turner, who was reported by the press to have competed at Le Mans with an injury she kept hidden from doctors so that she could race, was also second in the Biennial Cup event at the Donington Park road course. Ill health caused by diphtheria prevented her from competing in the 1938 24 Hours of Le Mans. In 1938, Stanley-Turner finished sixth overall and third in the \u22121100 category at the Rallye Paris \u2013 Saint-Rapha\u00ebl F\u00e9minin. She also took part in road races in Cork, Ireland in an MG car, where she was the eighth and final finishing driver. Stanley-Turner maintained her fitness by doing bell ringing that involves simultaneous exercise of the arms, diaphragm, legs and shoulders and was a member of the Oxford Diocesan Guild of Bell Ringers. She won the 1938 First Easter Road Handicap on a artificial road circuit designed by Malcolm Campbell at an average speed of in an MG vehicle, and also entered the Crystal Palace Plate, RAC Tourist Trophy (coming 22nd with Elsie Mary Wisdom) and the Imperial Plate, driving a MG Midget PB. In 1939, Stanley-Turner and other female drivers in Brighton collected funding for the British Motor Racing Fund to maintain the balance of power with Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom in international speed contests. That year saw her set a new woman's record held by Kay Petre at Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb in a 2-litre Alta she borrowed from a factory and was inexperienced in how it operated in a time of 43.4 seconds set on her second run. Stanley-Turner had entered a small 937 cc British car in the 1939 RAC Tourist Trophy before the Second World War broke out. On 3 August 1940, she was enlisted into the Women's Auxiliary Air Force as an Aircraftwoman 1st Class and was appointed an Assistant Section Officer, serving in a barrage balloon unit. Stanley-Turner was confirmed from a probationary role to a full Assistant Section Officer on 3 August 1941. She gave up her commission on 12 October 1950 and assumed a short service commission as Flying Officer WRAF five years on active list and four years on reserve, with seniority from 27 July 1947. Following the Second World War, Stanley-Turner was restricted to competing in the Coupe des Dames of the Monte Carlo Rally three times in the early 1950s, since it was hard for many drivers to return to motorsport and cars were difficult to acquire and those that were available were expensive. She was unable to compete in the Spa 24 Hours in 1948 due to illness that required her to undergo an operation. Stanley-Turner's Rallye Monte Carlo activities saw her drive a Alvis and achieve a career-best 32nd overall in the 1951 event. \n\n## Personal life\n\n She married Air Commodore Geoffrey Tindal-Carill-Worsley in 1951 after the two first met in 1941 and reunited five years later. The couple did not have any children. Stanley-Turner accompanied her husband to his postings in Far East Asia, acting as his hostess after she gave up her career. She died at home on 8 July 1995. Stanley-Turner's funeral took place at Church of St Nicholas, Combe St Nicholas on the afternoon of 14 July 1995 and was then cremated privately. \n\n## Legacy\n\n A circa 1938 gelatin silver print photograph taken by an unknown individual of Stanley-Turner sitting in a racing car was given to the National Portrait Gallery, London by Terence Pepper in 2014.", "Philippine Normal University Mindanao": "", "Bairwa": "Bairwa is the Ethnic group of Chamar Subcaste of Scheduled Caste&lt;ref&gt;", "Kathleen Hildreth Barnes": "Kathleen Hildreth Barnes (born October 11, 1952) is an American pediatric physical therapist and a university administrator.

It depicts a large number of disparate figures in pink, red, blue and yellow colours. It was shown during the 2017 and received media attention for its size. \n\n## Background\n\n The German painter Jonas Burgert was born in Berlin in 1969, studied at the Berlin University of the Arts in 1991\u20131996 and had a breakthrough in 2005. He draws motif from areas such as science fiction, comics and ideas of the subconscious. He says he aims to portray the expression and atmosphere of his subjects, and he avoids horror and violence. \n\n## Subject and composition\n\n \"Zeitlaich\" shows a large number of humans, animals and objects, painted in pink, red, blue and yellow colours. Central in the picture is a three-metre-high bald and dark-skinned man wearing a three-piece suit and pink gloves. Among the disparate subjects are tigers, flamingos, a headless zebra, embryos, a naked woman at a piano, a car and a human skull. Many animals are hard to determine and have traits of both cats and dogs. Burgert describes the picture as a \"concentration of irritation\" and says he wanted it to have \"this boundless excessive demand that we have\". Burgert created \"Zeitlaich\" in his studio in an industrial part of Berlin's Wei\u00dfensee area. He began to make the painting a year and a half before it was exhibited. The canvas is long and high and was the largest he had used. The picture is painted in oil using custom-made stepladders and metre-long extensions for the brush handles. Burgert sketched the figures individually and says the greatest challenge was to create drama despite the lack of interaction between the subjects. A time-lapse video posted on the Internet shows how \"Zeitlaich\" evolved. The first discernible figure was a human silhouette above the ground near the middle; the figure remains in the finished painting but in a heavily reworked form. Burgert then began with the part in the middle to the left, where there is a skip from which animals seem to emerge. \n\n## Reception\n\n \"Zeitlaich\" was first shown at the gallery Blain Southern in Berlin from 29 April to 29 July 2017, as the title work of a Burgert solo exhibition. An aerial work platform had to be used to mount it at the gallery. The exhibition began during the and the painting received considerable media attention, especially for its monumental size. In \"Kunstforum International\", Ronald Berg said \"Zeitlaich\" makes Burgert unique in contemporary art due to its combination of figuration and giant size, and that its success has contributed to turning Burgert into an artistic authority. Julia Schmitz of \"Schirn Mag\" stressed the size and said it takes serious effort both physically and mentally to explore the painting, which gives Burgert the opportunity to depict more facets of life than ever before. Gabriele Walde of the \"Berliner Morgenpost\" likened the picture to Antonin Artaud's theories about absurd theatre: \"things and figures whirl wildly in a disorderly manner, the perspectives tilt, everything is strangely skewed\". She described it as a \"motley Noah's Ark\" that viewers can try to find their way through. Berg said \"Zeitlaich\" shows what the medium of painting can achieve and described it as a \"daring attempt to depict human existence that transcends times, spaces and cultures\". Schmitz said it reminds her of Hieronymus Bosch's works but it also has its own strengths, and compared it to a \"tableau vivant\" where Burgert explores his usual themes of human excess, loneliness, vanity and hatred. Andrea Bressa of \"Icon Magazine\" called it an extremely fascinating combination of landscape, drama, psychology and fantastical elements, and wrote that other, smaller paintings in the exhibition appeared to contemplate the main work.", "Bruce Harris": "Bruce Harris may refer to:", "Eufijia": "Eufijia is a genus of flies in the family Stratiomyidae.", "Murray Cup (rugby league)": "The Murray Cup is a rugby league competition on the border of Victoria and New South Wales.

Jean Bertho died on 4 January 2023, at the age of 94.", "Courtship (animals)": "\n\n## In animals\n\n Many animal species have mate-selection rituals also referred to as \"courtship\" anthropomorphically. Animal courtship may involve complicated dances or touching, vocalizations, or displays of beauty or fighting prowess. Most animal courtship occurs out of sight of humans and so it is often the least documented of animal behaviors. One animal whose courtship rituals are well studied is the bower bird, whose male builds a \"bower\" of collected objects. From the scientific point of view, courtship in the animal kingdom is the process in which the different species select their partners for reproduction purposes. Generally speaking, the male initiates the courtship, and the female chooses to either mate or reject the male based on his \"performance\". \n\n## Sea turtles\n\n All animals have different courtship rituals that reflect fitness, compatibility with others and ability to provide. Sea turtles court during a limited receptive time. During the courtship, males will either nuzzle the females head to show affection or by gently biting the back of her neck. This may go on for long periods of time, depending on whether the female responds to the male. If the female does respond, by not fleeing, the male will attach himself onto the back of the female's shell using his front flippers. He will stretch his long tail under the back of the females shell to begin copulation. Courting can be competitive among males. The male that has better endurance will win the female. To a female, endurance is a great trait to be passed on to their offspring; the higher the endurance in the male, the higher the endurance will be in her offspring and the more likely they will be to survive. Female leatherback sea turtles will also choose many different males to copulate with in order to diversify their offspring, since it is known that leatherback sea turtles have female-biased offspring. \n\n## Hippopotamus\n\n Despite being aggressive animals, the female hippopotamus is very nurturing and sensitive when caring for offspring. Mating and birth both occur in the water for hippopotamus. This is because it gives them privacy when conceiving and helps conserve energy during birth. The female hippo normally averages around 5\u20136 years, while males are average an age of 7\u20138. During mating season the male hippopotamus will find a mate out of the herd, showing interest by smelling the female's posterior end. As long as the male acts submissive during the courting season, the adults in the herd will not interfere. Once the male finds the female he wants to mate with, he begins provoking the female. He then will push the female into the water and mount her. In order to alert the herd or other animals that may be lurking around, the male will let a loud wheezing sound. Preceding birth, the female exhibits aggressive behavior, leaving the herd until after the birth of the calf. Although hippopotamuses can mate anytime of the year, the mating season ranges from February to August. Because the energy cost is high, the female generally only has one offspring in a two-years span. \n\n## Honeybees\n\n The courtship behaviour of honey bees follows through two distinct types: \"apiary vicinity mating\" and \"drone assembly mating\". Apiary vicinity mating usually takes place in cool weather and is more local to the apiary from which the queen resides. The drones are in the same apiary too, but this doesn't not mean that it will lead to inbreeding. Drones assemble in a bulb of warm air close or far from the apiary. They are alert when the queen has flown out of the hive and will follow her route. This is followed by a sort of fast hum or buzz in the general bee population that follows an upward temperature gradient. The male drone mounts on the virgin queen and inserts his endophallus, ejaculating semen. The male honey bee will then pull away from the queen, but his endophallus will be ripped from his body and remain attached to the newly fertilized queen. The next male honey bee will remove the endophallus that was previously left by the other male honey bee and will eventually ejaculate and lose his own. The frequency of mating for the male honey bees is 7 to 10 times during a mating flight. Most of the drones die quickly immediately after mating, and their abdomen rips open since the endophallus has been removed. The few that survive are usually ejected from their nests, as they have served their sole purpose by mating. They only attend one mating flight, and the queen stores up to 100\u00a0million sperm within her oviducts during this flight, but only 5\u20136\u00a0million are stored in the spermatheca of the queen. Only a few of this sperm are used by the queen at a time to fertilize the eggs throughout her life. New queen generations will mate and produce their colonies if the queen runs out of sperm in her lifetime. The sex of the offspring is controlled by the honey bee queens, as the eggs passing through the oviduct can be determined whether they are fertilized or not by the queen. Research has indicated that eggs that are fertilized develop into female workers and queens, while the unfertilized eggs become drone honey bees. Female workers can lay infertile eggs but do not mate. The infertile eggs become male honey bees. The eggs of the queen are laid in oval-shaped structural cells that usually stick to the nest ceiling. Royal jelly is then filled with these cells to prevent larvae from falling. Soon-to-be workers are fed royal jelly during the first two days. The future queens are given royal jelly throughout the entire larval period. Each member colony development depends on caste. For proper growth from eggs to adult, the male honey bees need 24\u00a0days, 21 for workers and only 16 for the queens. \n\n## Insect species\n\n Certain insect species also display courtship behavior in order to attract mates. For example, the species \"Ceratitis capitata\" (also known as the medfly) exhibits these behaviors. During the courtship phase, signals are exchanged between males and females to display willingness for mating. The male begins with a series of head movements, then after 1\u20132\u00a0seconds of movement, also begins to fan its wings and moves closer to the female. Once the male is close enough to the female, the male will leap onto the female's back and begin copulation.

The series of records started in 1818; it forms the oldest set of records of phenological events in Switzerland and is one of the . In 2023, the first leaf was observed on 9 March, in line with the observations made in recent years (in 2022, it was observed on 10 March) \n\n## History\n\n Between 1808 and 1831, Marc-Louis Rigaud regularly observed a chestnut tree located on the in Geneva, and recorded the date of opening of the first bud on the tree. In 1818, an official tree was chosen, and the \"sautier\" (the secretary of the Grand Council of Geneva, the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) is in charge of regularly observing the tree, and of recording the date of the opening on an official register. This event is then announced to the press and to the general public, indicating the beginning of the spring. The tree chosen in 1818 died at the beginning of the 20th century, and a new tree was chosen in 1905. After its death in 1929, a third tree was chosen, which died due to a fungus infection shortly after the last record, on 13 March 2015. A fourth tree was chosen in September 2015, just across the Tour Baudet de l\u2019H\u00f4tel de Ville, the seat of government in Geneva since 1488. \n\n## Climate\n\n The dates of opening of the first bud of these chestnut trees, collected since 1808, form the oldest series of phenological records in Switzerland, and one of the oldest in the world.

It is a centrepiece of what Pevsner's Guide to Wiltshire described in 1960 as \u201ca stretch of palaces\u201d along Fore Street. Built in around 1720 for the wealthy cloth merchant Robert Houlton, Parade House has an elegant and symmetrical fa\u00e7ade typical of the Georgian period. It was home to a succession of merchants during the 19th century at a time when Trowbridge was flourishing as a wealthy market town, until becoming the headquarters of Usher's Wiltshire Brewery for most of the 20th century. \n\n## History\n\n \n\n## Robert Houlton\n\n Parade House was the creation of Robert Houlton, second son of local cloth merchant Joseph Houlton. Born in 1677, Robert appears to have been a giant of a man. No portraits survive, but there is a note in the register of burials for his death in 1738 that the coffin was \"2ft 9ins abreast and 6 ft 5ins long\". He married Elizabeth Grant of Bristol in 1704, but sadly both she and their newborn daughter died in childbirth in 1707. He married again in 1711 to Sarah Abraham of Frome Selwood but they had no children, and she died in 1732. Robert followed his elder half-brother Joseph Houlton II into the family business as a clothier. Though clearly capable and a good administrator - he was named as sole executor of his father's will - he seems to have lacked his brother's entrepreneurial zeal.  Upon the death in 1720 of Joseph I, Robert inherited all his father's property in Trowbridge except the family home at 66-67 Fore Street (which went to Joseph II). The inheritance included other properties in Fore Street including, according to a record from 1724, \"a bakehouse and a garden late occupied by Ann Stevens, widow\" and \"a house and garden late occupied by Ann Chivers\". \"Both [were] taken down and a house where Robert Houlton now lives built on the site thereof\". Construction of Parade House, probably began soon after Joseph I's death. Nothing is known about how Robert set about building this lavish new home, but at around the same point in time, his nephew Nathaniel Houlton (one of Joseph II's sons) was rebuilding 68 Fore Street in a similarly grand style, while rival clothier John Cooper was undertaking an equally spectacular project at 64 Fore Street (now Lloyds Bank). All were completed at around the same time in the early to mid-1720s. An article in the Gloucester Record newspaper published around 25 years later said that Parade House \"consists of five large lofty rooms on the first [or ground] floor, viz. a spacious hall and two very good parlours in the front neatly wainscoted, a drawing-room, a servants-hall, and two stair-cases behind; a proportionable number of lodging-rooms on the second and third floors with closets and other conveniences, the front freestone carved and sash\u2019d; a court before the house with iron gates, and a large paved court behind; the kitchen, cellars, and offices under ground, exceeding convenient and well-supplied with water; a pleasant garden behind with a good wall. It stands on the cleanest spit of ground in the town, a good distance from the common road, and a convenient distance from the church and market.\" Robert resided in Parade House until his death in 1738 and was interred alongside his father and his second wife Sarah in the vault of the Unitarian Meeting House in The Conigre. However, his death, without issue and without a will, caused a certain amount of confusion. Administration was granted to his nephew Joseph Houlton III, but Robert appears to have been heavily indebted, and most of the estate was eventually divided between his creditors. These included John Cooper, the owner of 64 Fore Street, who took control not only of Parade House but also Robert's mills and other estates. \n\n## After 1740\n\n With a grand house of their own just up the road, the Cooper family had no need to live in Parade House, and the property was let for several years to one Maurice Jarvis, apothecary. In 1765, the Cooper family put the building up for sale and it was purchased for \u00a3450 by another clothier, Isaac Green, who lived a little further down the Parade. Green too let out the building, on this occasion to another tradesman, Thomas Turner, who had recently married Joanna Cook, one of the founders of Trowbridge's Tabernacle Church. Turner set himself up as a seller of \"all sorts of grocery, spirituous liquors, tea, coffee, chocolate, etc. wholesale and retail, the best of its kind, and at the lowest prices\". The business was conducted on the ground floor of the house, most probably, while the family lived upstairs. The Turners, however, suffered a terrible fate when only a year after they moved in the house was badly damaged in a fire caused accidentally by a careless serving boy. This forced them to move further down the road to 75 Fore Street.  Following repairs, the house was let for a time to Elizabeth Bythesea before being purchased by Thomas Turner in 1790. A few years later he was obliged to surrender the property to the Tabernacle minister John Clark after defaulting on debts, and it was eventually purchased by Thomas Timbrell, of a local family of lawyers and bankers. Throughout this period, though, it continued to be let to a series of tradespeople: John Ching, grocer and linen draper for most of the first decade of the 1800s, and later by surgeon and apothecary John Warren Cary. The Timbrell family eventually sold the house in 1839 to the cloth merchant Samuel Salter, who let it to his niece Sarah and her husband Jesse Gouldsmith, who later became general manager of Salter's Home Mills on the site of what is now the Shires shopping centre. The Gouldsmiths lived at Parade House until 1863 when they moved to a large mansion in Clifton. Parade House was owned and occupied for a while by JG Strachan, another partner in Home Mill, but he too put the building up for sale in 1866. It's not clear who owned the building for the rest of the century, but it was once again let to tradespeople throughout that period. These included the dentist and chemist William Honey Hayward until 1880, and subsequently the drapers and dressmakers Arthur and Sarah Heathcote, who lived and traded from the property until 1901. In the 1911 Census, Parade House was occupied by Miss Kate Morris, an unmarried dressmaker, together with her assistant Sophia Pearson. Shortly afterwards, the building was acquired by Usher's Wiltshire Brewery, under whose ownership it was to remain for almost the next 100 years.", "Taff Rahman": "Taffazul Islam Rahman (born 1983) is an English football manager.

He was an early member of the JASON advisory group. \n\n## Early life and education\n\n Case was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in Manhattan. His father was a successful businessman who owned a paint manufacturing company. His mother was from an affluent family of German-Austrian Jews. Case, under the original family name Cassoff, attended the Ethical Culture School and then Fieldston. When he was in high school, his parents changed the family name to Case in the belief that this would improve their son's prospects. Ken was accepted for undergraduate studies at Harvard and matriculated in 1941, exempted from the World War II draft by extreme nearsightedness. \n\n## Manhattan Project\n\n In 1943, Case was one of several Harvard physics undergraduates who relocated to Los Alamos, New Mexico, to work on an undisclosed project\u2014the Manhattan Project. He soon came under the influence of J. Robert Oppenheimer and was also working alongside other well-known physicists. Case developed new methods for calculating neutron transport and for estimating the explosive yield of bomb designs. \n\n## Completion of education\n\n After the war, back at Harvard, Case completed his undergraduate degree and subsequently began graduate work under Julian Schwinger, earning his Ph.D. in 1948. He was then awarded a fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where Oppenheimer was now director. Case's two years work at IAS on fundamental problems in field theory produced little of lasting importance, in part because of his insistence on using his mentor Schwinger's difficult formalism rather than the equivalent formalism of Feynman which was much more widely adopted by physicists. \n\n## Career\n\n After an additional postdoctoral year at the University of Rochester, Case in 1951 accepted a faculty position at the University of Michigan, there turning from fundamental physics to the application of deep mathematics to applied problems, initially plasma waves and related transport theory. (For the latter, he became a consultant to General Atomics in San Diego.) This work continued for about a decade, culminating in a 1960 paper that was subsequently cited more than 500 times. In 1961, Case was invited to join the JASON advisory group, a group of scientists who met for six weeks every summer to advise the U.S. government on technical problems in national security. Case's involvement with JASON became a focal point of his work, often leading to efforts, some publishable but others classified, that continued beyond the JASON summer gathering. JASON reports in the 1960s through 1980s on topics close to Case's expertise include many on nonlinear wave phenomena in plasmas, and in underwater acoustic and turbulent phenomena. Case was reportedly a part of the informal \"JASON Navy\", a subset of the group who worked for the U.S. Navy on highly classified issues relating to U.S. missile submarine security. Other JASON Navy members included Walter Munk, Edward Frieman, William Nierenberg, and Curtis Callan.

He was also a Galileo Circle Fellow of the University of Arizona (2018) and a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union (2019). Showman directly advised 11 graduate students and mentored many more across the disciplines of planetary science, atmospheric sciences, and geosciences. He was known as a dedicated teacher and was passionate about explaining the complicated details of planetary physics to his students. He developed eight courses in planetary sciences, including two graduate courses. \n\n## Research\n\n Showman's early research on the atmospheric dynamics of exoplanets demonstrated that the difference between the day and night side on hot Jupiters would drive strong eastward equatorial winds, comparable to or greater than the speed of sound in the medium. This work shaped the field and was spectacularly verified in subsequent observations. Showman and his collaborators went on to extend their innovative models beyond hot gas giant planets, to tidally-locked and fast-rotating planets of smaller sizes and cooler temperatures as well as to larger and warmer brown dwarfs. \n\n## Professional activities\n\n Showman was deeply involved in the exoplanet science community and collaborated with many observers to interpret their observations of exoplanet atmospheres and working with theorists to advance modeling techniques.

It is a non-invasive form of liquid biopsy, i.e. biopsy from blood, which analyzes activated macrophages (CD14+/CD16+) for disease-specific epitopes, such as tumor cell components. Macrophages are part of the human immune system. They are involved in the detection, phagocytosis and destruction of organisms which are deemed harmful. In case of cancerous tumors, macrophages ingest tumor cells and dissolve them with the help of enzymes, storing tumor proteins intracellularly, even when little tumor mass is present. With the help of EDIM technologie, activated macrophages containing intracellular tumor epitopes can be detected using CD14 and CD16 specific antibodies. \n\n## Areas of Application\n\n Currently, EDIM technology is used for the blood test PanTum Detect. Here, the method is applied to examine which individuals would benefit from further cancer detection examinations with imaging procedures (MRI, PET/CT) to clarify a possible tumor disease.

He was shocked, and he had to tell her that Hussein was her son, and he asked her to return to remarry him, but she refused so as not to distort her image with Hussein as his mother, and she asked him not to tell him her truth, and she decided to move away from Hussein and breakup with him. Abdel Hamid was forced to tell his son the truth about his mother, and that she was his wife and he is the reason for what she reached, and that he hurt her and deserves punishment, and he did not bear the admonition of his son, and suddenly, he died. Hussein went to his mother, Aisha, and told her that he had learned the truth, and accompanied her to Alexandria to live with him. Ahmed Fahmy spread rumors that Hussein had brought the dancer to live with him in his house, after the death of his father, but Hussein told the factory workers that this woman was his mother, not his mistress, and it is true that she is a dancer, but he cannot abandon her because she is his mother, and Naima returned to Hussein after knowing the truth, but Latifa Hanim confronted her former co-wife, Aisha, to prevent her daughter from marrying her son, but Aisha exposed her in front of her daughter, Naima, that she caused her for being divorced from her husband and deprived her of her son, while she took a lover until her husband divorced her and she married her lover, and Naima could not abandon her mother, despite her dissatisfaction with her behavior.

He joined the Teutonic Order in 1547. He was Komtur of Mergentheim from 1547 to 1549, Komtur of Frankfurt from 1549, and Landkomtur of the Bailiwick of Franconia from 1557. He was also Komtur of Regensburg until 1565, when then Grandmaster Wolfgang Schutzbar revoked his position. In 1566, when Schutzbar died, his successor, Georg Hund von Wenkheim, recalled Heinrich and made him Komtur of . After Georg Hund's death in 1572, Heinrich was elected Grandmaster of the Teutonic Knights on March 17. In 1576, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II appointed him as administrator of the Princely Abbey of Fulda.  Unlike his predecessor, he was much more lenient towards Protestants and less supportive of the counter-reformation, which deteriorated relations between him Maximilian II. Relations only worsened with Maximilian's successor, Rudolf II, who in 1585, forced Heinrich into being a coadjutor, with him and Rudolf both sharing the title of Grandmaster. Rudolf's brother and Maximilian II's son, Maximilian III, would attempt to wrestle control of the order away from Heinrich. Maximilian III's efforts were largely irresistible. After Maximilian took the oath on October 20, 1585, Heinrich was forced to surrender the Mergentheim Palace, the residence of the Teutonic Grandmaster since 1527. The following year in 1586, Heinrich was forced to surrender the Teutonic coat of arms, regalia, and the titles of Hochmeister and Deutschmeister. On February 20, he was forced to give up the administration of the Imperial Abbey of Fulda to Maximilian. Heinrich attempted to retake control of the order, however, the governor of Mergentheim halted his efforts in 1587. In 1585, shortly after the Hapsburgs began to seize power over the order, Heinrich retired to the Deutschmeister's chamber house in Weissenburg, Alsace. In 1590, having already de facto lost all power over the Teutonic Order, Heinrich officially relinquished his position of Grandmaster of the Teutonic Knights. He died in Weissenberg on March 21, 1595, and was buried in the local \"Kommendenkirc\" (or Commandery Church).", "Carotid agenesis": "Carotid agenesis is a vascular anomaly in which the carotid artery, normally present in the neck, does not develop during embryogenesis. The common carotid artery splits into the external carotid artery and internal carotid artery, with the internal carotid artery supplying blood flow to areas of the brain. Carotid agenesis can involve either the right carotid artery, left carotid artery, or both. Fewer than 1,000 people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with this disease and it is often found incidentally on imaging. \n\n## Symptoms and diagnosis\n\n Patients can be asymptomatic, but symptoms include neurological symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, seizures, muscle weakness, or paralysis of cranial nerves. Those with carotid agenesis are also at an increased risk of aneurysms. Diagnosis is typically made through imaging studies such as magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA). These tests can visualize the absence of the carotid artery and the compensatory blood flow through other vessels. An important distinction seen on imaging between carotid agenesis and carotid hypoplasia is the complete absence of the carotid canal in carotid agenesis. Additional imaging studies may be necessary to evaluate the extent of the anomaly and the presence of any other associated abnormalities. \n\n## Treatment\n\n Currently, there are no specific treatment options for carotid agenesis. This is primarily because carotid agenesis may be an incidental finding in a patient that is asymptomatic due to collateral blood flow that develops through the vertebrobasilar system. Treatment is therefore focused on managing the neurological symptoms of the disease, including medications to treat blood pressure, cholesterol, or blood thinners to prevent the formation of blood clots. Additionally, treatment can address improving flow through collateral pathways through vascular reconstruction surgery or stenting.", "Liz Shore": "Elizabeth Catherine \"Liz\" Shore, Lady Shore of Stepney, (n\u00e9e Wrong; 19 August 1927 \u2013 20 February 2022) was a British general practitioner and civil servant who served as the Deputy Chief Medical Officer of the United Kingdom from 1977 to 1985.

He was cited as looking like a boy down the block and being wholesome looking. His father was a linotype operator. He was an all-state highschool player in 1972 at Apopka High School and he was named Mr. Apopka Memorial High School for 1972\u201373. Rumors circulated that a bounty was put on him due to his skill. He wanted to attend either Auburn University or the University of Florida. He suffered a right-shoulder separation in his next to last game of senior year which hurt his recruitment chances. Hall did well in the physical aptitude test at Army, to the point that Homer Smith thought it was exaggerated. Hall had concerns about joining Army, and was told he would not make it there. Hall later stated that he joined Army due to not receiving any other offers. Hall made his debut for Army on November 2, 1974, in a loss against Vanderbilt. He scored the team's only offensive touchdown of the game and was cited as a possible quarterback for Army going forward.

As a junior, he ranked in the Top 10 nationally in throwing and total offense. In his senior year, he started the season by throwing five touchdown passes againstUMass. This not only set the single game touchdown record for Army but also helped him set the career touchdown pass record at Army. These passes also helped contribute to his school record for 3,558 passing yards. Hall would later break two additional records at Army and broke 18 passing and total offense records. He was described as a one-man football team. His records were partially cited as occurring due to an increase in the use of the forward pass. He was said to be a candidate for the All-American team and the Heisman Trophy for the 1977\u201378 season. He finished his college career with 5,502 yards and 426 completions.

These representatives were responsible for the financial and religious affairs of the Shia community, especially for the collection of religious taxes like Khums. Following the same tenet of political quietism to which Shia Imams adhered, these representatives also took on the role of directing and organizing the Shia community. In particular, Faris was the intermediary with the followers of al-Hadi in the Jibal, which encompassed the central and western parts of modern-day Iran. Faris was involved around 862 in a dispute with another representative, Ali ibn Ja'far, and was consequently banned by al-Hadi from receiving alms on his behalf. He continued to do so, however, without forwarding them to al-Hadi, who excommunicated Faris in 864 for embezzling religious dues. Later when Faris continued to openly incite against al-Hadi, the latter called for his death, and he was indeed assassinated during the imamate of Hasan al-Askari, the successor of al-Hadi. \n\n## Dispute with al-Hadi\n\n In Samarra, located in modern-day Iraq, Faris served as a senior representative of Ali al-Hadi, the ninth Imam in Twelver Shia. There he was involved in a conflict with another representative by the name of Ali ibn Ja'far al-Hamani. This dispute let to acrimonious arguments on both sides and created discomfort in the Shia community. Moreover, the local representatives of al-Hadi were unsure which of the two agents they shoud entrust with their collected religious dues. Al-Hadi sided against Faris and ordered his representatives not to use the latter for their business with al-Hadi. At the same time, he requested that his representatives refrain from talking about his choice to avoid provoking Faris. According to the Twelver author Kashshi, al-Hadi did this because Faris was an influential person and served as the primary intermediary between al-Hadi and the Shias of Jibal, who usually sent their religious obligations to al-Hadi through him. Despite al-Hadi's orders to the contrary, Faris received funds from that region, which he did not deliver to al-Hadi. At this point, al-Hadi decided to make the issue public and requested that his representatives inform the Shia community that Faris was no longer to be trusted and funds intended for the Imam should not be handed to him. Then in two letters, one dated Tuesday 9 Rabi al-Awwal 250 AH (20 April 864), he officially anathematized Faris. After that, Faris started an open campaign against al-Hadi. The sources do not provide details about his activities except that he allegedly turned into a significant troublemaker who called people to in an effort to attract them to his side. In a letter he sent to some of his supporters in Samarra, al-Hadi accused Faris of \"a wicked utterance\". The deterioration of the situation is evident in al-Hadi's next action, the extraordinary, though unprecedented, call by al-Hadi to assassinate his rebel agent. One of his followers later executed this order. \n\n## His followers\n\n Faris was very attached to Muhammad, the son of Ali al-Hadi, who died a year or two after Faris was assassinated, probably in the hope that he would be the next imam's top operative. After Ali al-Hadi passed away, the devotees of Faris remained faithful to Muhammad, and although he had died before his father, they he was regarded as the legitimate Imam by them. Ali al-Hadi, who had designated Hasan as his successor, as well as Hasan himself, who, in contrast to Ali al-Hadi's third son, Ja'far, backed his father's activities against Faris, were the targets of this act of rebellion. In this way, the followers of Faris formed their splinter group among the Imamia community against Hasan\u2019s followers and believed that Ja'far, Muhammad's younger brother, was chosen by Muhammad to succeed him, and that Ja'far was the true Imam after Ali al-Hadi. There were allegations that Muhammad had obtained the Imamate's treasures from his father as his appointed successor and gave it to his personal assistant Nafis, who then delivered it to Ja'far. Therefore, during the reign of his brother Hasan al-Askari, Ja'far had gathered a few followers, mostly from among the adherents of Faris.", "Slafkovsk\u00fd": "Slafkovsk\u00fd is a Slovak surname.

This method differs from the plain weave, which lacks this decorative aspect. \n\n## Origins\n\n According to sinologist Dieter Kuhn, during the Han Dynasty in China, a swivel weaving method was used as part of \"zhicheng\" tapestry weaving. During the Ming Dynasty, weavers from Nanjing, particularly those specializing in cloud brocade, honed the art of \"zhuanghua\" swivel weaving, using colored wefts to form patterns.  In Europe, Dutch and British weavers and inventors started experimenting with swivel weaving looms in the early eighteenth century. By the mid-twentieth century, their use had declined significantly, because similar effects could be produced more efficiently on Jacquard looms. \n\n## Technique\n\n Swivel weaving is a decorative technique that involves producing intricate designs on other weaves, such as a basic plain weave structure or satin. In swivel weaving, the weft yarns are used to create patterns on the fabric. The weft threads are interlaced with the warp threads in a specific order to produce the desired pattern on the fabric. This technique is aided by the use of small auxiliary shuttles that hold and transport the colorful threads, in addition to the main fabric looming fly shuttle. These swivel shuttles are responsible for forming the designs, while the regular shuttle creates the base structure. Swivel weaving is characterized by minimal waste. Typically, contrasting colors were utilized for the designs. The Dotted Swiss is an example of a swivel weave, where dots may be formed on a sheer fabric. Swivel weaving was superseded by more cost-effective methods for producing patterns on the surface of fabrics. \n\n## Lappet weave\n\n In contrast to swivel weaving, which produces figures with extra weft yarns, lappet weaving employs additional warp yarns. Lappet weaving creates a similar type of weave design on one side, while swivel weaving differs by producing the design on both sides. Additionally, the method of fastening the design yarns in lappet weaving results in the production of more robust fabrics compared to those produced through swivel weaving.

His parents were German immigrants. He moved to with his family to Vincennes, Indiana, when he was two. They stayed there for four years, and after a year in Garden City, Kansas, they settled in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Morgenstern graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 1901 and was ordained a rabbi at Hebrew Union College in 1902. He then spent two years doing post-graduate work in Germany, studying Semitics at the University of Berlin and the University of Heidelberg. He received a Ph.D. from the latter university in 1904. He then returned to America and became rabbi of Congregation Ahaveth Achim (later known as Temple Israel) in Lafayette, Indiana, for the next three years. He then became Professor of Biblical and Semitic Languages at Hebrew Union College, where his systematic and thorough methods made him a successful teacher. When Kaufmann Kohler retired as president of the College in 1921, he became acting president. In 1922, he was elected president, although he continued to teach Bible courses to rabbinical and post-graduate students. Morgenstern was the first Hebrew Union College alumnus to serve as its president. Under him, the students, faculty, and college activity all grew rapidly. New departments of education, social studies, and Jewish music were established, new buildings were erected, and an endowment fund was created. The college, which was previously part of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, became independently chartered. The Hebrew Union School of Religious Education was founded in New York City, New York. The \"Hebrew Union College Annual\" was established in 1924 and immediately became a prominent publication in Jewish scholarship. He helped a dozen European scholars escape Nazi Germany and bring them to the College. He was originally an anti-Zionist, although he changed his views following the creation of the state of Israel. While he was studying in Germany, his former classmate Judah Leon Magnes suggested he study Semitic languages. He developed a close relationship with some of his professors on the subject, including Friedrich Delitzsch, Bruno Meissner, Carl Bezold, and Carl Heinrich Becker. He focused on Assyriology in particular, with his dissertation called \"The Doctrine of Sin in the Babylonian Religion.\" His time studying Assyriology inspired him to support Biblical criticism, which he felt was dominated by Christian scholars that dismissed the Jewish perspective. He presented a paper on the subject in the 1915 Central Conference of American Rabbis, which proved controversial and faced strong opposition from older rabbis, but it helped push Reform Judaism and Hebrew Union College to start studying Biblical criticism. His work in Biblical scholarship led him to be president of the American Oriental Society from 1928 to 1929, president of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis in 1941, and one of two American honorary members of the British Society for Old Testament Study. Morgenstern served as president of Hebrew Union College until 1947 and continued to teach at the College until 1960, at which point he moved to Macon, Georgia. He received an honorary D.H.L. from the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1937 and an honorary D.L. from the University of Cincinnati in 1947. The University of Heidelberg also gave him the unusual honor of renewing his degree in 1954. He was the Bible specialist for the board of editors of the \"Universal Jewish Encyclopedia\". He preferred the term American Judaism over Reform Judaism, considered American Judaism more pragmatic and less dogmatic than earlier Reform Judaism, and believed Reform and Conservative Judaism would ultimately merge. He was secretary of the Central Conference of American Rabbis from 1907 to 1913, president of the Alumni Association of Hebrew Union College from 1916 to 1918, American vice president of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, executive of the Jewish Agency, and a member of the American Academy for Jewish Research, B'nai B'rith, and Theta Phi. In 1906, he married Helen Thorner. They had one child, Jean Greenebaum. Morgenstern died at a nursing home in Macon, on December 4, 1976.

It is a recent addition to the genus (2019), currently considered a member \"incertae sedis\". Its name honors Antonio Machado-Allison, an ichthyologist responsible for a great deal of work on the genus \"Bryconops\". \n\n## Description\n\n The holotype, or first collected specimen, of \"Bryconops allisoni\" was 7.25cm SL (standard length). Other collected specimens range from 2.76-6.86cm. This makes it slightly smaller than other members of the genus, which usually range from 6 to 8 cm SL. The body is generally slender, deepest in the region of the dorsal fin, and the snout is relatively long, about 23-29% of the length of the head. The scales of \"B. allisoni\" are silvery with a greenish iridescence, and parts of the snout are tinted brown. (Silver or greenish coloration is not uncommon in the genus as a whole.) It bears an iridescent-green lateral stripe that turns black when it advances onto the caudal fin, and the caudal fin also has a red blotch of pigment just above this stripe; the dorsal fin may have a spot of red, and the adipose fin is red entirely. The pelvic, anal, and dorsal fins are almost completely clear with scattered chromatophores (color cells). The presence of a stripe on the caudal peduncle on the caudal fin is a feature shared with \"B. chernoffi\", \"B. inpai\", and \"B. melanurus\", but various factors differentiate said species. In \"B. inpai\" and \"B. melanurus\", the stripe is longer, advancing onto the dorsal lobe of the caudal fin, and \"B. allisoni\" has more predorsal scales than \"B. chernoffi\" (10-12 vs. 8-9, respectively). \n\n## Sexual dimorphism\n\n Mature males of \"B. allisoni\" are equipped with bony hooks on select fin-rays. This is a feature seen in many other members of \"Bryconops\", though the specific appearance may vary depending on the species, sometimes more accurately being described as barbs or spines; for instance, hooks are well-defined on the anal fin of congener \"B. munduruku\", but there are smaller spines on \"munduruku's\" dorsal and pelvic fins. Otherwise, there are no documented morphometric or coloration differences between males and females. \n\n## Taxonomy\n\n \"Bryconops allisoni\" has been considered a member of the genus \"Bryconops\" since its description in 2019. There are two subgenera in \"Bryconops\", \"Bryconops\" and \"Creatochanes\", and B. allisoni exhibits synapomorphies of both; multicuspid teeth on both maxillae and well-denticulated gill rakers from \"Creatochanes\", but a shorter jaw structure associated with \"Bryconops\". Therefore, \"B. allisoni's\" subgeneric status is yet undetermined. It is still considered a member of the genus \"Bryconops\" \"incertae sedis\". The specific name \"allisoni\" is in honor of Venezuelan ichthyologist Antonio Machado-Allison, who has written or co-authored a large amount of literature concerning the taxonomy of \"Bryconops\". \n\n## Distribution and ecology\n\n \"Bryconops allisoni\" is only known from the lower rio Tapaj\u00f3s, appearing solely in small, right-bank tributaries. It is the most recent species described therein; excluding \"B. allisoni\", there are thought to be at least nine species cited from the middle and lower Tapaj\u00f3s basin. The congener \"B. munduruku\" specifically was also originally described from a right-bank tributary of the Tapaj\u00f3s, and \"B. allisoni\" occurs syntopically with congener \"B. melanurus\". \n\n## Conservation status\n\n \"Bryconops allisoni\" has not been evaluated by the IUCN. Based on patterns seen in other members of the genus, it may be under threat of various anthropogenic hazards, including illegal mining and farmland settlement. The Tapaj\u00f3s main has been subject to such intense mining activity in the past that portions of it have turned entirely brown due to sediment addition and disturbance. However, its type locality, the Corredor Ecol\u00f3gico stream, is a tributary of the Tapa\u00f3s located in the Tapajos National Forest, a large area of protected land. Therefore, there are already measures in place that may aid in its survival as a species.", "KMED": "KMED may refer to:", "No eres t\u00fa, soy yo (disambiguation)": "No eres t\u00fa, soy yo is a 2010 Mexican film by Alejandro Springall.

It was officially ratified on 17 August 1914. The Declaration also emphasized the unique Baltic identity of the Lithuanian nation as well as its old tradition of statehood. The authors of the Declaration are Jonas Basanavi\u010dius, Stasys \u0160ilingas and Donatas Malinauskas. The Declaration is named after the proclamation that compared ethnic Lithuania to an amber necklace, which was torn apart due to Germany's historical \"Drang nach Osten\". \n\n## Background\n\n The signing of the declaration was motivated by the geopolitical situation in Europe that began changing at the early stages of World War I. The great powers of the time sought to ensure support from stateless nations to gain an advantage: for instance, the Russian Empire on behalf of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich sent a manifesto to Poland promising to give them back their land once annexed by Germany and Austria\u2013Hungary and grant them autonomy in exchange for their loyalty and showing \u201crespect to the nations, which were united with you by territory\u201d. Reacting to the political situation unfolding in Russia, the Lithuanian intelligentsia, alongside Estonians, Latvians, Armenians and others, began expressing their interest of gaining some form of autonomy in Russia. The Lithuanian Declaration sought to secure Lithuania's political interests within the Russian Empire. However, it avoided any direct claims of full sovereignty at the time. According to the memoir written by Martynas Y\u010das, the document also defended Lithuania's national identity and history by stating the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of Lithuania is a bloody riding-hag of battles with teutonism. Lithuanian nation was the first one, which had to face the Germanic storm raging against Slavism. And in this battle we tied ourselves to Slavism. While we are not Slavs ourselves, we \u2014 as bright and flexible amber \u2014 blended into the sea of Slavism, bright because our friendship (collaboration) with the Russian nation was never clouded by anything throughout the epoch of independent Lithuania when the Lithuanian nation determined its faith and fulfilled its will in its own right.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Amber Declaration also vaguely alluded to the Battle of Grunwald as proof of historical unity between Slavs and Balts fighting against a common enemy, encouraged Lithuanians to support the Russian Empire in its struggle against the Central Powers.", "Dalmahoy baronets": "The Dalmahoy Baronetcy, of Dalmahoy, was a title created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 2 December 1679 for John Dalmahoy of that Ilk.

Throughout the Cold War the battalion was the army's only NBC defense unit. Formed in 1976 the battalion received the flag and traditions of the Chemical Regiment, which had been formed in 1936 and served in World War II. \n\n## History\n\n On 1 July 1923 the Royal Italian Army constituted the Chemical Service, which began to experiment with chemical warfare agents and means of delivery. By 1934 the Chemical Service had grown to two battalions. The same year chemical companies and flamethrower platoons were formed for each army corps, and a chemical unit was formed in Rome. During the 1935-36 Second Italo-Ethiopian War Italy repeatedly used chemical weapons against Ethiopian troops and civilians, which were exclusively deployed by the Royal Italian Air Force. Do expedite the army's capabilities to deploy chemical weapons the Chemical Regiment was formed in Rome on 1 January 1936, by reorganizing the Chemical Unit formed earlier. The regiment consisted of a command, a depot, the I Battalion with three chemical companies, and the II School Battalion with a chemical company, a Model 35 flamethrower company and a Model 35 mortar company. On 21 October 1938 the regiment received its flag. In April 1940 the regiment changed composition and now consisted of a command, a depot, the I School Battalion, the II Mortar Battalion, the III Chemical Battalion, the IV Mixed Battalion with a two flamethrower companies and a nebulizers company. Chemical units were tasked with ensuring that troops and units were trained and prepared for chemical defense, as well as tasked to employ chemical weapons if so ordered by the army general staff. \n\n## World War II\n\n After the outbreak of World War II the regiment's depot began to mobilize new units: By 6 November 1940 the Chemical Service consisted of: On 1 January 1942 the Chemical Regiment was reorganized as follows: Throughout the war the Italian military did not use chemical weapons, and the chemical unit's mortars were employed with conventional munitions, while many of the smaller chemical units were employed as smoke and fog generating units. The Chemical Service and the Chemical Regiment were disbanded by invading German forces after the announcement of the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943. \n\n## Cold War\n\n In 1952 the Italian Army's Artillery Inspectorate formed a Chemical Defense Office tasked with providing the Italian military with nuclear, biological, and chemical defense. On 1 October 1961 the office was elevated to ABC Defense Inspectorate. In October 1957 the existing fog generators and flamethrowers company was reorganized as Experimental ABC Company and assigned to the ABC Defense Office. In 1964 office and company changed their names from ABC to NBC. On 1 March 1967 the company was expanded to NBC Defense Battalion. Based in Rieti the battalion consisted of a command, a command and services company, the 1st NBC Company (Experiments), and the 2nd NBC Company (Training). In 1969 the battalion added the 3rd NBC Company (Training). During the 1975 army reform the Italian Army disbanded the regimental level and newly independent battalions were granted for the first time their own flags. On 15 September 1975 the battalion was reorganized and now consisted of a command, a command and services company, and two specialized NBC companies. On 1 February 1975 the battalion was renamed 1st NBC Battalion \"Etruria\" and assigned the flag and traditions of the Chemical Regiment. On the same day the NBC Defense Inspectorate was merged back into the Artillery Inspectorate, which was renamed Artillery and NBC-defense Inspectorate. The inspectorate contained an NBC Office that controlled the Etruria, which acted as the army's central training institution for all NBC defense personnel, which after training was assigned to operational units. On 1 May 1994 the Italian military's Joint Forces Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defence School moved to Rieti and merged with the 1st NBC Battalion \"Etruria\".

His parents divorced when he was young, and he later explained that growing up in poverty fueled his leftist politics. Mellen went to community college and later enrolled at UCLA before dropping out. Inspired by the writing of Jack Kerouac, he moved to San Francisco in the late 1950s. He then attended San Francisco State College, where he began protesting the proliferation of nuclear weapons. After gaining a PhD from the University of Iowa, Mellen took a position as a political science and international affairs professor at Drew University. Mellen lost this job in 1965 after, during a talk at a teach-in, expressing support for Eugene Genovese's opinion that a victory for the Vietcong victory in the Vietnam War was not to be feared. Following his termination, Mellen went to teach in Dar es Salaam in 1966 and returned to the US in 1968. He then became a strong advocate in the anti-war organization Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), despite being older than many of the members. It was during his time with the SDS that Mellen met people who would eventually form the Weathermen. \n\n## Weather Underground\n\n As a principal author and one of the 11 signatories of the 1969 Weathermen manifesto, Mellen became a founding member and the intellectual backbone of the Weathermen. He brought Marxist theory and a sense of seriousness that the organization had previously lacked. The manifesto advocated for revolutionaries, regardless of race, to unite to destroy \"U.S. imperialism and the achievement of classless world: world communism.\u201d In 2016, Mellen claimed he was only involved in a less radical early draft of the manifesto. Mellen became less active in the Weathermen and eventually left as the group started to embrace more violent methods and became the Weather Underground. The FBI have said that the Weather Underground eventually claimed to be behind for 25 bombings. \n\n## Later life\n\n In the 1980s, after earning a law degree, Mellen started a law practice in the San Francisco area that mainly assisted disadvantaged clients. After retiring in 2008, he moved to Zirahu\u00e9n, Mexico, with his wife, Terry Baumgart. Mellen died at home on February 17, 2023, from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

It was described in 1944 as a small bodied flamingo species known from assorted fragmentary remains, including bones of the tibia and the wings. The discovery of juvenile remains suggests that the locality where the fossils were found represents a shallow lagoon or mudflat that housed a breeding colony. \n\n## History\n\n The remains of \"Phoenicopterus stocki\" were discovered in the early 20th century by a field party of the California Institute of Technology led by Chester Stock in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. The field party uncovered nine fragments belong to a species of flamingo later described by Loye H. Miller. The type specimen of this taxon was the distal end of a left tibiotarsus, but additional material from various parts of the body have also been referred to this species. This additional material includes the proximal end of a tibia, possibly belonging to the same individual as the holotype as well as two differently sized humerus fragments. Some of the material is thought to have belonged to juvenile birds not yet capable of flight. All the material initially assigned to the species was uncovered from an area known as Arroyo de los Ponos, also known as CIT locality 289. Additional material would later be collected from the same site as well as the nearby Arroyo de los Burros. \n\n## Description\n\n Miller described that \"Phoenicopterus stocki\" shares the morphology of extant \"Phoenicopterus\" species, but notes that the animal was much smaller, referring to it as a \"pygmy\". The tibiotarsus generally agrees more with the American flamingo in its proportions, being shallower than in the greater flamingo. The intercondylar area is much more narrow than in any extant flamingo and the intercondylar notch, located on the elements distal border, is almost in the center of the condyle which sets it apart from the more recent \"Phoenicopterus minutus\". The fragment of the tibia is described as distinctive by Miller, but is not included in the species diagnosis due to the uncertain relationship between it and the holotype tibiotarsus. The inner articular facet for instance does not extend as far back as in either of the Neotropic \"Phoenicopterus\" species, the American and the Chilean flamingo, and instead appears to be closer to the greater flamingo of Africa and Eurasia. In the same fashion the postero-axial border of this facet is shaped almost like the arc of a circle and the posterior notch shallow, both characteristics shared by the greater flamingo but neither of the neotropic species. Although Miller did not have \"Phoenicoparrus\" skeletons available for comparison, he compared the Pliocene material to skins of said genus and determined that \"P. stocki\" was smaller than either James's flamingo or the Andean flamingo. Related to the tibia, Miller notes that the ratio between its transverse diameter and the sagittal diameter is greater than in the American flamingo but smaller than in \"Phoenicopterus copei\". Both wing bones collected at the Rinc\u00f3n fossil locality are vastly different in size. While the larger is approximately the size of the same element in the Chilean flamingo, the smaller is outside the range of any adult flamingo known today. Miller places both specimens in \"P. stocki\" due to the great variability in leg to wing proportions, specifically citing Chilean flamingos and greater flamingos. Still, the possibility of a second flamingo from the locality is not discarded entirely. A later publication by Hildegarde Howard also mentioned the small size of Stock's flamingo, writing that the species was small in size, but not as small as \"Phoenicopterus minutus\" from the Pleistocene of California. \n\n## Paleobiology\n\n \"Phoenicopterus stocki\" likely led a similar lifestyle to modern flamingos, wading through water and filtering small organisms using a specially adapted bill. Subsequently, it is inferred that the Rinc\u00f3n locality where the material has been found represents what used to be a shallow lagoon or mudflat during the Pliocene, a conclusion further supported by the presence of not yet volant juveniles. This would mean that flamingos not only fed at the side, but nested and raised their young there as well. Support for this hypothesis is also lend by the other bird remains found there, which generally belong to aquatic species.", "Syahredzan Johan": "Syahredzan bin Johan (born 10 June 1983) is a Malaysian politician and lawyer who has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bangi since November 2022.

Like other fish in the genus \"Scopelarchus\", \"S. guentheri\" has an opaque colored body.  \n\n## Distribution\n\n \"Scopelarchus guentheri\" can be found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Within the North Atlantic, \"S. guentheri\" has only been found in the Caribbean Sea, and throughout the entire Atlantic Ocean it is thought that \"S. guentheri\" lives primarily in tropical and subtropical waters. In the Pacific Ocean, \"S. guentheri\" can most commonly be found in warm waters, however there is evidence suggesting that \"S. guentheri\" is most common in the Pacific Ocean in areas peripheral to the equator, clear of the intersection between the North Pacific Gyre and South Pacific Gyre. In the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, \"S. guentheri\" has only been found between the latitudes 20\u00b0N and 30\u00b0S, although the highest concentrations are between 10\u00b0N and 10\u00b0S.

The visual system of \"S. guentheri\" has been studied via optical and electron microscope, where the retina of the species was described. The main retina of \"S. guentheri\" can be distinctly broken down into the anterior and posterior regions; the anterior region is characterized by a uniform distribution of rods anchored to an unspecialized pigment epithelium while the posterior region is characterized by bundles of rods bound by tight junctions. The secondary retina, known as the accessory retina, is similar in structure to the posterior region of the main retina and is characterized by bundles of rods, although the bundles are irregular in the accessory retina. The posterior region of the main retina is especially striking due to the symmetry of the rod bundles, and the pigment cells of \"S. guentheri\" are triangular in shape, which is distinct from the commonly polygonal shape of other teleost's pigment cells.", "Lina Abu Akleh": "Lina Abu Akleh (Arabic: \u0644\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0627\u0642\u0644\u0629) is a Palestinian-Armenian human rights advocate who was named as one of the BBC's 100 Women in 2022.

It was released by Sony Classical Records on 8 March 2011. \n\n## Reception\n\n In his five-star review, Jonathan Broxton wrote \"Jane Eyre does retain a highly classical and constant tone throughout the score, so listeners who require variety, or more action-based stimulation in their film music, are likely to find Jane Eyre something of a one-note effort. Personally, however, I found the score to be a triumph from start to finish. It's not a romantic score in the sense that Delerue wrote romantic scores \u2013 Charlotte Bront\u00eb's stories are too dour and too steeped in mist and bracken for that \u2013 but Marianelli's subtle, searching writing still allows the romanticism inherent in the story to shine through. It's a score which carefully weaves a musical web with strings as fine as silk, and draws the listener in.\" \"Filmtracks.com\" wrote \"Altogether, the atmosphere shines elegantly at times while fading into brooding contemplation for the majority, and unless you have established yourself as a fan of dynamic virtuoso violin performances in prior film scores (such as in James Newton Howard's \"Defiance\" recently), Jane Eyre could leave you doubting all the positive buzz about this score. It's music that is meant to give you chills in subtle doses, and it clearly transcends \"Pride &amp; Prejudice\" and will rival \"Atonement\" for sympathetic ears. Patience will be required to fully appreciate this very somber score's well-timed 44-minute album experience, one that is far easier to respect for its technicalities than enjoy for its demeanor.\" James Christopher Monger of \"AllMusic\" commented on the score, saying: \"The music is appropriately dark and stormy, with long, drawn-out melodies that echo the foggy moors and wet dirt roads of the English countryside. Marianelli and Liebeck dutifully capture the Gothic undertones of Bronte's influential novel while maintaining a sense of the bittersweet sentimentality that drives the mismatched lovers to such lengths, resulting in the perfect soundtrack for the cold, gray rains of March.\" Daniel Schweiger of \"AssignmentX\" wrote: \"Dario Marianelli never fails to astound with his melodic and emotional sumptuousness, with each score like \"Jane Eyre\" almost impossibly besting the other. The Bronte sisters couldn't have found a better man to musically speak for their heroines in the form of an Italian who can so beautifully play England's agelessly repressed class system and the mental wreckage it reaps.\" Andy Gill of \"The Independent\" mentioned that Marianelli's score and Liebeck's \"sporadic flourishes of wild Gypsy violin lend a windswept romantic character to the music, in which the rippling piano motif cranks the tension inexorably up\" and added that there is \"a pleasing unity to the score, a sensibility which links the brooding warmth and the chill shiver of strings\". For the track, \"The End of Childhood\", he said that \"the harp, strings and piano are tinted with hints of woodwind and vocal in the upper register, like harbingers of complex adulthood\". A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" wrote \"Dario Marianelli's music strikes all the right chords of dread, tenderness and longing.\" Oliver Lyttelton of \"IndieWire\" calling it as \"one of the best scores and soundtracks of 2011\", commented that: \"Marianelli's haunting melodies will follow you out long after the film is over.

For example, one name can be used domestically and another used when dealing with institutions outside China. The arrangement can be achieved by either \"adding a name\" () or \"externally reserving a name\" (). \n\n## Adding a name\n\n An organization can acquire an additional name when it is responsible for multiple duties or uses an additional name when dealing with foreign institutions. Such organizations usually do not have separate leadership or staff because of additional names. \n\n## Externally reserving a name\n\n \"Externally reserving a name\" is when an organization that has absorbed another can continue to use said organization's name for bureaucratic purposes. For example, the United Front Work Department (UFWD) uses the name of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO), which it absorbed in 2018, when making statements related to overseas Chinese affairs. In this case, the organization may have a separate nominal leadership team for the reserved name organization, that concurrently can also serve in the leadership of the bigger organization (e.g. Chen Xu both officially serves as the director of the OCAO and a deputy head of the UFWD). In some cases, the reserved name organization can seemingly retain their internal structures (i.e. the China National Space Administration seemingly has a large internal structure and is a reserved name for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology).  \n\n## Examples\n\n According to scholar Anne-Marie Brady, the State Council Information Office is an example of a \"public face\" for \"foreign propaganda work\" of the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party.

It was his entry for the 1528 competition held by the confraternity of San Pietro to produce an altarpiece at Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice, as did Titian (whose entry was destroyed by fire in 1867, though a print of it survives) and Pordenone (whose entry survives in the Uffizi) and also shows the asssassination).  Titian won the competition but the congregation of flagellants (\"disciplini\") in Alzano was looking for a work to be their high altarpiece for their new church dedicated to Saint Peter Martyr and showed interest in Palma Vecchio's work. That church was rebuilt in 1510-1529 and the work may have been acquired during those years. The altarpiece in which the work was placed to complete the apse was probably designed by Pietro Isabello, Palma's friend and contemporary, who had also designed the church. Bernard Berenson identified the work as a Lorenzo Lotto from 1514-1515 - that artist knew Palma well and may have acted as a link between the artist and the flagellants.

He says photographs do not do it justice and likens it to \"something found on Easter Island\". He says the technique of carving directly in marble, without a clay or plaster model, gives it \"an earnest of Vorticist energy, of vitalism\". \"The Independent\" profiled it in 2013 as part of an article series on \"great works\".

The strip began publishing on February 24, 2019 on Webtoon. The strip is published in seasons, of which there are currently four, and during these seasons new comics are published on a weekly basis every Monday.  The series has received praise for its artwork and storylines.  \n\n## Synopsis\n\n The series predominantly focuses on Gwendolyn, a sixteen-year-old princess of the Pastel Kingdom who was raised with the utmost love and consideration from her father and three siblings. She, like her siblings, have all been raised in their castle and kept somewhat hidden from the outside world. This results in Gwendolyn developing a sweet disposition but also becoming a bit sheltered from the outside world and its norms. As a result Gwendolyn is also unaware that her green skin and hair, particularly when contrasted against her siblings' conventional good looks, sometimes causes others to mistake her for a monster or witch. It isn't until Gwendolyn and her two sisters are introduced to their future husbands that she truly becomes self conscious of her appearance, as she overhears her fianc\u00e9 Frederick refer to her as ugly. This rejection causes Gwendolyn to develop low self-esteem and question her existence. It is then that she receives an invitation to a club referred to as the \"CPC\", which her family assumes is a well known and influential princess organization. When she eventually gains the courage to attend one of the gatherings, Gwendolyn discovers that the CPC actually stands for the \"Cursed Princess Club\". This organization is made up of princesses who have been ostracized from their respective kingdoms for various reasons, ranging from enchantments and curses to their appearances. Led by President Calpernia, the CPC teaches its members to love and support themselves and others, as well as to question and challenge the norms that consider them to be outcasts.  \n\n## Development\n\n Cursed Princess Club was originally created as an entry for a contest on Webtoon. LambCat chose to focus on fairy tales due to several tropes common to the genre and because it caused them to ask the question \"What if the spells didn't break and there wasn't a happily ever after? What would that scenario be like?\", which in turn led them to consider themes of insecurity and self-love. While not selected to proceed past the first round, LambCat was contacted by an editor who encouraged them to continue developing the series.  LambCat has stated that they have the ending plotted out, but that \"It is still going to be very difficult to get there.\" \n\n## Publication\n\n \n\n## Webtoon\n\n \"Cursed Princess Club\" began publication on February 24, 2019 on the webtoon hosting service Webtoon. As is typical with webtoons, the strip is released in seasons, each of which are made up of a varying amount of episodes. As of January 2023 the webcomic has been read over 232 million times and has approximately 2.1 million subscribers.  \n\n## Print\n\n In November 2021 Webtoon announced their new imprint, Webtoon Unscrolled, through which they would release print editions of select series. The announced series included Cursed Princess Club and on January 3, 2023 the first volume was published. The different publication style required some alterations to the layout and speech bubbles.  \n\n## Reception\n\n The series has received praise for its messages of body positivity and self-love. In a review for the first volume of the series the \"School Library Journal\" stated that it was an \"affirming first volume in which the cast acknowledges inner beauty and stands firm with one another.\" CBR praised the series for its messages and art style, noting that the series had a wide appeal and that \"The overarching theme of challenging stereotypes and finding beauty within resonates with a universal audience.\"", "Claudio Abarca": "Claudio Antonio Abarca G\u00e1lvez (born 7 January 1994) is a Chilean footballer who plays as a goalkeeper.

But the Abbasid Arab governor of Egypt invaded Ifriqya, defeated the Nafusa in a battle at Tawergha in 761 (his third attempt - his first two armies had been repulsed) and put an end to their putative new state. However, the Nafusa mountains themselves remained unconquered. Throughout the 9th century, while the Aghlabids ruled in Ifriqiya, the Ibadi maintained an independent puritan republic in the Nafusa mountains. The Imamate of Nafusa was in close alliance with the other Ibadi remnant, the Rustamid dynasty in Tiaret, both constant thorns on either side of the Aghlabids, in communication with each other across the back highlands of North Africa. In 879, the Tulunids of Egypt invaded Aghlabid Ifriqya and captured Tripoli. But the Nafusa challenged and destroyed the Egyptian army in 880. Again the Nafusa victory was short-lived. In 896\u201397, the Aghlabid emir Ibrahim II of Ifriqiya recovered Tripolitana and defeated the Nafusa in a great battle at Manu (south of Gab\u00e8s). In the aftermath, citing them as heretics, Ibrahim II executed all the Nafusa prisoners and put an end to their independent imamate (Tahert fell shortly after, in 911). Despite the destruction of their states, Ibadi Islam remained a strong (if clandestine) faith among the Berbers of the Nafusa mountains for centuries after, down to the modern day.", "Roger F.

The current painting had a prominent place in the exhibition. Concerning the subject, it is interesting to note that unlike Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who captured this same environment in a bustling moment in 1876 and 1889, respectively, Casas opted to give a sad and sordid image of the place. Casas captured a wide panoramic view of the dimly lit room, with only two figures dancing and others in the foreground, in an indifferent attitude.

It is dedicated to Saint Nicholas. It is located in the village of Prnjavor, Serbia, which is about 10 km from Bato\u010dina and about 15 km from Kragujevac. The monastery represents an immovable cultural asset as a cultural monument.  \n\n## History\n\n According to legend, the monastery was built during the reign of King Stefan Dragutin at the end of the 13th or the beginning of the 14th century. Legend has it that the monastery was first built on \u010cukara near the spring of Mladens water. During the invasion of the Turks, the church was demolished and a new Grn\u010darica was built from its materials in today's hidden place. It is more likely that the Grn\u010darica monastery was built in the middle of the 16th century, after the restoration of the Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107. According to the inscription above the entrance door, Grn\u010darica was \"created and listed\" during the time of the Turkish Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent through the efforts and efforts of Abbot Maxim and his brotherhood. The word \"created\" was also used when the church was being rebuilt after demolition or neglect. In the Turkish census of 1739/41, the monastery was marked as the monastery of St. Nicholas near the village of Grn\u010darica, but it was deserted. The monastery most likely came to life again at the end of the 18th century, during the reign of the Belgrade vizier Had\u017ei Mustafa Pasha, who was remembered for his gentle attitude towards the Serbian people, which is why he was called the \"Serbian mother\".  It is not known how, but in 1835 Grn\u010darica was not considered a monastery, but only a parish church. With the arrival of the Defender of the Constitution, the position of Gra\u010danica was adjusted and it again became a monastery. Professor Josif Veseli\u0107 from Kragujevac visited and described monasteries in Serbia in 1861 and 1862. Describing Grna\u010drica, he said that the walls were plain, rough and cracked, much damaged, painted over, but also with preserved old paintings. In the middle hung a gilded and beautifully decorated pole, like the other one in the church's vestibule. The pathos is made of brick, and the pulpit is made of white and blue marble from Studenica. The monastery had all the necessary church books with the three gospels. There are a lot of illegible inscriptions on the walls, and the one that talks about the restoration of the monastery during the time of Suleiman the Magnificent is the best read. Veseli\u0107 also says that it is known for certain that the monastery was burned down in Ko\u010dina Krajina. During the First World War, the Austro-Hungarian army ravaged the monastery, burned the archive and took away three bells. The monastery suffered the same fate during the Second World War. The Germans exiled the monks, the monastery quarters and set fire to the monastery. After the war, in 1946, Abbess Efrosini came to the abandoned and destroyed monastery with four nuns from the Monastery of Saint Petka in Izvor near Para\u0107in. Since then Grn\u010darica became a women's monastery. \n\n## Architecture\n\n The monastery church has a triconchal base, vaulted with a semi-shaped vault with a slender octagonal dome above the central space. The altar apse and side conchs are semicircular on the outside and inside. To the west is a massive square belfry with four bifores. The facades are without decorative ornamentation.

Trained in figure painting, Hatfield specialized in genre painting, particularly scenes of children at play. Later in his career, he concentrated on landscapes. Hatfield also supplied illustrations for periodicals. His drawings for The Yellow Wall-paper, a short story by Charlotte Perkins Stetson, were published by \"The New England Magazine\" in January 1892. Noticing that many artists' oil paints in general use darkened over time, Hatfield decided to make his own. Starting in his basement with pigments imported from Europe, he developed a line of paints he called Hatfield's Hand Ground Artists Oil Paints. When the business outgrew the basement, Hatfield built a small factory behind his house in Canton Junction. In 1898 he opened a retail store, Hatfield's Color Shop, in the basement of the Hotel Ludlow in Copley Square. Hatfield sold his paints along with other artists' materials, and hosted exhibitions of the works of other artists. After his death in 1928, the shop was run by his elder daughter, Doris. The business had branches in the Massachusetts towns of Cambridge, Rockport, and East Gloucester.  In 1885 Hatfield married Flora E. Barber in Vermont. They had two daughters, Doris (1888\u20131977) and Pauline (1899\u20131950), who often served as models for their father. The 1900 U.

He also received the title of \"Imperial Factor for the Mercury in Amsterdam\". The mercury came from Idrija in today's Slovenia, and was exported to Venice as well as Amsterdam. De Witt also helped Deutz sign a commercial treaty with the Spanish Crown, which used the mercury in the silver mines of Mexico. In 1669 he managed to acquire the monopoly by buying up all the shares of the Venetian competitors. After his death, his widow Geertruid continued to run the company and granted Emperor Leopold I loans during the Great Turkish War against the Ottoman Empire and the War of the Spanish Succession.

The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site, since 2008. \n\n## Overview\n\n Ogura Castle is located on a 70-meter high ridge overlooking a U-shaped bend in the Tsuchigawa River in the western part of Hiki District of Saitama Prefecture. The Tsuchigawa River flows from eastern edge of the Chichibu Mountains, forming the border between the towns of Ogawa and Ranzan. The valley below Ogura Castle, is called Ranzan Valley and the scenery has been compared with Arashiyama in Kyoto for its autumn leaves.  The castle covers an ares of 600 by 200 meters and extends from the southwest to northeast. As the eastern slope is rather gentle and had a flat space before the river suitable for a castle town, the castle faces east. It consists of two large enclosures. The main enclosure is trapezoidal and measures 80 by 40 meters, and is divided into upper and lower areas. There were gates at the north, south and each directions, each with stone walls. South of the main enclosure was a dry moat and the secondary enclosure with dimensions of 80 by 30 meters. This enclosure was also protected by a high clay rampart and another dry moat. East of the main enclosure is a small trapezoidal third bailey, with stone walls that are three meters high. Aside from these core areas, the castle had many terraces on the slopes of the ridge and dry moats to obstruct the advance of any enemy. The castle makes more use of stone walls in its fortifications than was normal for the time; however, the stones were small, flat pieces and were stacked like bricks. This type of construction is unique in the Kant\u014d region. \n\n## History\n\n As with many neighboring castles in the area, as Sugiyama Castle or Sugaya Yakata, the origins of Ogura Castle are uncertain. By tradition, it was built by the Ueda clan, who were retainers of the Uesugi clan with a base at Musashi-Matsuyama Castle, 10 kilometers to the east. However, another tradition states that it was built by the Toyama clan, who were also retainers of the H\u014dj\u014d clan. The Ueda were descendants of one the seven main bands of samurai in Musashi Province and were important retainers to the Ogigayatsu Uesugi clan in the latter half of 15th century. In the early 16th century the Ueda were allied with Ota Sukemasa, lord of Iwatsuki Castle against the H\u014dj\u014d clan. The Ueda later switched fealty to the H\u014dj\u014d and as a result were attacked and defeated by Uesugi Kenshin, who seized Musashi-Matsuyama Castle in 1560. The H\u014dj\u014d assisted the Ueda in recovering their territory in 1563; however, Musashi-Matsuyama Castle was at the eastern edge of their territory, and Ogura Castle was more centrally located. The Ueda clan disappears from history at the time of the destruction of the H\u014dj\u014d clan in 1590 at the hands of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Ogura Castle was abandoned and fell into ruin around that time.  In 2008, the site received protection as one of the four \"Hiki Fortified Residence Sites\" in Saitama, including the Sugaya Yakata, Musashi-Matsuyama Castle, and Sugiyama Castle.

She worked as a writer for various magazines, specializing in articles about domestic and women's issues, and was an editor for \"Pageant\" and \"Look\" magazines and editor in chief for \"Homemaker's Digest.\" She published the book \"Networking: The Great New Way for Women to Get Ahead\" in 1980, which promoted networking amongst women to combat exclusion from opportunities as the result of old boys networks. Welch was an active feminist who was a member of the National Organization for Women. \n\n## Early life\n\n Welch was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1919. She graduated from the University of Illinois, where she was secretary of the student council, president of Kappa Gamma and a recipient of the Phi Beta Kappa key. She was commissioned by the Navy during World War II as a member of the first group of officer candidates to qualify with WAVES at Smith College. She worked as an aid to Admiral W. B. Young as the first woman in the position. In 1943, she married marketing and advertising executive Barrett Welch, with whom she had a son and three daughters. The couple lived in Cincinnati, Ohio, for the first two years of their marriage while her husband was stationed in the city as a captain in the ferry division of the Air Traffic Control. She worked for \"Esquire\" and \"Coronet\" in Chicago after the war as their news stand promotion manager and later as their west coast representative, when she moved to New York City with the magazine, where she spent the majority of her career. \n\n## Career\n\n Welch worked as a freelance magazine writer, publishing work in a variety of publications, including \"Redbook\", \"Esquire\", \"Ladies' Home Journal\", \"Woman's Day\", \"Vogue\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", \"Reader's Digest\" and \"\". She worked as an editor for \"Pageant\" and \"Look\" magazines and as the editor in chief for \"Homemaker's Digest\". She wrote articles on women's issues, including homemaking and networking, job-hunting and working as a woman. She wrote an article about her daughter's rape and another article about moving back to the city from the suburbs. Welch planned to write a book with Caroline Bird and Catherine Shipe East about women who established legal precedents using Title VII, but it was never published. She wrote books on travel, cooking and etiquette, including \"Your First Hundred Meals\" (1948) and \"The Family Wilderness Handbook\" (1973). Her most famous work was \"Networking: The Great New Way for Women to Get Ahead\" (Harcourt, 1980). The book was born out of a 1977 article that she was asked to write for \"Redbook\", a list of the ten best corporations to work at for women. She did not find any companies to write about for her article, but she did discover a network of informal arrangements between women who were able to refer her to other women to assist. Welch wrote an article about this phenomenon instead and eventually published the book, which aimed to help women advance their careers when they were unable to rely on the \"old boy\" networks enjoyed by men. While researching for the book, she discovered internal networks at companies including Exxon, General Electric, NBC, \"Newsweek\", ABC-TV, and \"Reader's Digest\" where women could exchange information, invite speakers to lead discussions on topics such as sex discrimination in the workplace and support each other. The book included a directory of women's networks across the country and excerpts were published in \"Vogue\", \"Glamour\", \"Ms.\" and \"Working Woman\". The book was the first instance of the use of the word \"network\" as a verb, and it was credited with promoting the \"networking movement\" amongst women. \n\n## Activism\n\n She was a member of the advisory boards for the Cornell University Institute for Women and Work and the National Organization for Women (NOW). She coordinated the rape prevention movement for NOW during the 1970s.

According to the Book of Genesis, Zibeon was the father of Anah, whose daughter Aholibamah was Esau's wife, before 1963 BC according to the Ussher chronology. Although called a Hivite, he may be the same as Zibeon the son of Seir the Horite who is mentioned in the First Book of Chronicles, with Horite signifying 'cave-dweller' and Hivite being the name of his tribe, for nothing is known of any race of the Troglodytes; or perhaps \u05d4\u05b4\u05d7\u05b7\u05d5\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9 ('the Hivite') is a mis-transcription for \u05d4\u05b4\u05d7\u05b9\u05e8\u05b7\u05d9 ('the Horite').  Another difficulty connected with this Zibeon is that Anah in Genesis is called his daughter, and his son; but this difficulty may perhaps be explained by supposing that \u05d1\u05ea refers to Aholibamah, and not to the name next preceding it. The Samaritan, it should be observed, has \u05d1\u05df. An allusion is made to some unrecorded fact in the history of the Horites in the passage \"This [was that] Anah that found the mules in the wilderness as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father\".

It was the first newspaper established for the Romanian minority of post-Trianon Hungary and it is the one with the longest and widest level of circulation within the country. \"Foaia Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\" was founded by the Cultural Union of the Romanians of Hungary in the summer of 1950 and was originally known as \"Libertatea Noastr\u0103\" (\"Our Freedom\").

At first, the redaction team was located at the teachers' room of the Nicolae B\u0103lcescu Romanian Gymnasium, Primary School and College of the town of Gyula ( or ), and it was mostly composed by teachers. In the end of 1957, the headquarters of the newspaper were moved to Budapest, the newspaper was renamed to \"Foaia Noastr\u0103\" (\"Our Sheet\") and most of the redaction team was changed as well. They were returned to Gyula in 1971. In 1978, the newspaper adopted a regular weekly publication. The new staff attempted to be as close to the readership as possible and get as many subscribers as possible, reaching an all-time high of 1,500 in the mid-80s, with hundreds of these being in Romania.

It is located in the village of Nesland. It is one of the churches for the \"Vinje og Nesland\" parish which is part of the \u00d8vre Telemark prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in 1847 using plans drawn up by the architect Hans Linstow. The church seats about 110 people. \n\n## History\n\n The first church at Nesland was a small wooden stave church that was built during the 12th century. An inscription in the church states that on 8 August 1242 the church was consecrated, likely due to a renovation or change in the building (this was likely not the first time the church was consecrated), perhaps it was when the chancel was built since that part of the building was newer than the nave. The church measured about long, making it a very small church. The choir was unusually high, raised several steps above the floor of the nave. Eventually, after several centuries in use, the church was deemed to be too small for the parish. Plans from Hans Linstow were used to build a new church on a site about to the north of the old church. The new church was a simple, small, wooden long church where the choir is in the same room as the nave. The church has a west tower with a church porch at the foot of the tower. Magnus Brostrup Landstad tried to preserve the old church building, but he was overruled and the old church was torn down after the new church was consecrated. The reason being that the local parish farmers did not want to spend money keeping up the old building in addition to the new one. Landstad wrote about the church saying: \"[it made] a strange impression. The sparse lighting, the narrow room, the choir's unusual height above the nave, the unusual paint applied to the walls and ceiling, and above all the impression that one was in the same, probably very little changed, surroundings, among which the fathers of 600 years ago sat in devotional assembly, and where, according to all reasonableness, the first Christian born in this place had worshipfully bowed his knees to the Lord.\"", "Clarias pseudonieuhofii": "Clarias pseudonieuhofii is a species of clariid catfish from Borneo.

This species is distinguishable from most other Southeast Asian forest \"Clarias\" species (except \"C. nieuhofii\") by the combination of the following characters:  \"Clarias pseudonieuhofii\" differs from \"C. nieuhofii\" by a shorter anal fin, a longer pelvic fin, and a shorter occipital process, all in somewhat slight measurements.

The company was founded by Annie Walker in 1989, after she moved to North Texas from Taiwan with her family. After a stint working for Fendi Timepieces as a regional manager in Dallas, Walker started importing karaoke laser discs from Taiwan. The company was incorporated in 1994, at which time it acquired its current name. The name derives from the logo of the laser disc business, a singing dog, which in Chinese, is \"hui guo\", which sounds something like \"way go\", which to Walker's ear, was transliterated into English as \"Well Go\". At first the company worked with a Taiwanese distributor, then when that went under, started distributing discs there, before moving into the U.S. market. In the mid-2000s it started focusing on straight-to-video releases, the first being a golf instruction DVD by British golfer David Leadbetter. As DVDs became less popular and VODs more so, along with the growing demand for Asian action movies, Well Go started focusing on films and the VOD market. It bought the sole rights to the distribution of the sequel to \"Ip Man\" on VOD, which was a huge hit. Over time it expanded into other genres, including horror and indie films. \n\n## Description\n\n Well Go is located in Plano, Texas. Since 2014 and as of September 2019, Doris Pfardrescher and Dennis Walker (daughter and son of founder Annie Walker) were CEO and CFO/COO respectively.

As well as selling the DVD versions of films, it also deals directly with streaming services like Netflix and Hulu as well as platforms like iTunes and YouTube. In 2019 it established its own service, called Hi-Yah (stylized as Hi-YAH!). As of 2019 Well Go released around 18\u201320 movies theatrically, and a total of around 50\u201360 films total including VOD and DVD, each year. In October 2021, it entered into a partnership with LazuArts Entertainment, the first Black-owned dubbing studio, which also specializes in localization of anime films.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1996. \n\n## Overview\n\n , located in Yamato Province (present-day Kashihara in Nara Prefecture), was the Imperial capital of Japan for sixteen years, between 694 and 710. The palace occupied a plot measuring about 1\u00a0km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and its \"Daigokuden\" (\u5927\u6975\u6bbf) and other palace buildings were the first palace structures in Japan to have roof tiles in the Chinese style. Roof tiles were considered prestigious, and a symbol of continental culture and the advanced state of the central administration.  The Muneyoshi Tile Kiln ruins are located on a slightly elevated slope of a hilly area surrounded by farmland. The presence of kilns in the era was reflected in local legends which stated that the famed Buddhist priest K\u016bkai instructed the locals on the manufacturing of roof tiles during his travels in this region of Shikoku. During the Taisho period, round eaves tiles with the same design as tiles used the southern wall surrounding the Daigokuden Palace of Fujiwara-ky\u014d were discovered. Archaeological excavations have found the remnants of at total of 24 tile kilns, the oldest dating to the Asuka period (approximately 650 AD), along with the foundations of a building with standing pillars, believed to be the remains of a workshop.The No.17 kiln was 13 meters long by 2 meters wide by 1.4 meters high, making it one of the largest known \"noborigama\" kilns in Japan. It is theorized that the firing section was extraordinary long because the large quantities of roof tiles required for the Fujiwara-ky\u014d Palace necessitated large-scale production techniques. Both flat and round tiles were produced at this site, and chemical analysis of tiles recovered from Fujiwara-ky\u014d has verified that the clay came from deposits located within ten kilometers of the Muneyoshi Tile Kiln Site.  Initially, the site was believed to have been a government industrial site specifically for the Fujiwara-ky\u014d Palace construction. However, later excavations found that roof tiles predating the Fujiwara-ky\u014d Palace were used in the local Myon-ji temple ruins and the H\u014dd\u014d-ji temple ruins in Marugame came from this kiln. This indicates that the kiln was operated by local ruling families prior to its involvement with the palace project.

She was also a show host and a magician. She is perhaps better known for playing \"Agripina\" in the major Puerto Rican television sitcom hit, \"La Criada Malcriada\" and for her participation, alongside daughter Angela Meyer, in the 1980s talk show, \"Ellas al Mediodia\". \n\n## Early life\n\n Deb\u00e9n was born in Managua, Nicaragua, the daughter of the well-known Ricardo Richardine, Sr., a Spaniard magician of that era. Deb\u00e9n only stayed in Nicaragua for eleven days; on December 23, 1922, her family left that country as they returned to Puerto Rico. In her early years, Deb\u00e9n lead a nomadic life, as she began traveling extensively when she went to Peru at age nine, taking piano lessons there and debuting as a professional singer. She then spent time touring South America, singing and dancing as part of a show that she starred on. Later on, as part of a show in which her father was the star, Deb\u00e9n toured Europe under the nickname of \"La Princesa de Nangl\u00edn, La  Dios\u00e1 Mar\u00eda de la Magia Negra\" (\"The Nanglin Princess, Goddess Maria of Black Magic\") \n\n## Acting career\n\n Deb\u00e9n finally settled permanently in Puerto Rico when she was able to find stable work as an actress at San Juan's Teatro Tapia, where she found steady work as a theater actress, which in turn also led to her touring the island to act at plays in different Puerto Rican cities. It was then that the well-known actor Luis Antonio Rivera, also known as \"Yoyo Boing\", recommended her for the character of \"Agripina\" in the show named \"La Criada Malcriada\". In 1970, Deb\u00e9n joined Rivera and Rosita Velazquez, among others, in another Puerto Rican television sitcom, this time named \"Mi Hippie Me Encanta\" (\"I Love My Hippie\"), which was another major hit in the island-country. Deb\u00e9n then moved to Canal 7, where for a time, she became a puppeteer on Rosaura Andreu's television show, \"Titi Chagua\". Deb\u00e9n was in charge of the puppet known as \"Do\u0148a Fantasia\" (\"Missis Fantasy\") in that show. \n\n## Later years\n\n In the mid-1980s, Deb\u00e9n joined her daughter, \u00c1ngela Meyer and several other actresses such as Magali Carrasquillo, Camille Carrion, Elia Enid Cadilla, Carmen Belen Richardson and others, in a Canal 11 talk show named \"Ellas al Mediodia\" (\"Women at Midday\") which was a major television hit in Puerto Rico. The show was eventually cancelled by Canal 11, but it was picked up by Canal 2 and renamed \"Ellas...Para Ti\" (\"Women For You\"), where, along with Meyer and Richardson also, Deb\u00e9n was rejoined with Rosaura Andreu. When at Canal 2, the show continued being an audiences favorite in Puerto Rico. Deb\u00e9n then decided to retire from the public eye. \n\n## Death\n\n Deb\u00e9n died of a heart attack on October 10, 2010, at the Juan de Dios home for the elderly in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. \n\n## Personal life\n\n Deb\u00e9n had one known daughter, Puerto Rican actress and show host \u00c1ngela Meyer. ", "North Staffordshire Tramways Company": "The North Staffordshire Tramways operated a steam tramway service from 1881 to 1898 in the Staffordshire Potteries area. \n\n## History\n\n The North Staffordshire Tramways Company Limited was formed on 4 December 1878. The \"Stoke-on-Trent, Fenton, Longton and District Tramways Order\" of 1879 was sanctioned by the Tramways Order Confirmation Act of 11 August 1879 to build four routes of tramway. The company acquired the assets of the Staffordshire Potteries Street Railway Company on 2 March 1880 and continued to operate it between Hanley and Burslem until it rebuilt it in 1882. The North Staffordshire Tramways Order of 1880 sanctioned the building of five additional routes. Both acts of parliament sanctioned the use of steam engines, and this was the company's selected method of motive power. The first routes to be constructed ran from Stoke centre to Longton Market Place via Fenton, with branches along Longton High Street and Trentham Road. These were inspected by Major General Charles Scrope Hutchinson of the Board of Trade on 4 January 1881. However some issues must have been found as it required a further inspection which happened on 22 April 1881. The company did not have authority under the Act of Parliament to operate steam engines on the branch lines and the approved Longton terminus of the Stoke route at Bank House was not even at the Market Place. The company was also in dispute with the North Staffordshire Railway Company in relation to the rebuilding of canal bridges in Hanley and Stoke. The tramway company had provided the girders, but an impasse was reached. It was only with the intervention of Major General Charles Scrope Hutchinson in August 1881 who found in favour of the tramway company that the deadlock was broken. The line from Stoke to Hanley was inspected by Major-General Hutchinson of the Board of Trade on 19 December 1881 and opened for public service on 21 December 1881. It closed a few days later for work required at Hanley, and opened again at the end of January 1882. From Hanley to Burslem the change of gauge from to meant that for a short while in 1882 the horse tram line ran at the side of the road whilst the steam tram line was in the middle of the road waiting for Board of Trade sanction. Horse drawn tramcars were replaced by steam around June 1882. The company obtained a number of steam engines by Merryweather and also Manning Wardle. However, these proved to heavy for the rails, weighing in around 13 to 15 tons each. They were also costly to operate at around 14d per mile, with a daily working of 67\u00bd miles per engine. At the company's annual meeting for the 31 December 1882, the shareholders agreed to obtain 15 Wilkinson type engines which weighed in at 8 tons with an operating cost of 8d per mile. By 1892 the company was running over 5\u00be route miles comprising one main route from Longton-Fenton-Stoke-Hanley-Burslem with a one-mile cross-town route in Stoke. \n\n## Fleet\n\n The original list of locomotives is recorded by H.A. Whitcombe. \n\n## Closure\n\n In 1895 the licence to operate steam engines expired, and the Board of Trade inspection recommended conversion to another method of propulsion. The Potteries Electric Traction Company was formed by British Electric Traction to take over the assets of the North Staffordshire Tramways Company. The company was acquired on 27 June 1898 and conversion to overhead electric followed shortly afterwards.", "2022 King's Cup": "The 2022 Annual King's Cup Football Tournament (), commonly referred to as 2022 King's Cup, is the 48th King's Cup, the annual international men's football tournament organised by Football Association of Thailand.

He gave public performances in his mid-teens, and won awards at classical music festivals in Glasgow and Edinburgh. In 1925, he toured in the U.S., making concert appearances. In Scotland, he also toured and recorded popular music with his brother Chalmers Wood and with a band, the Five Omega Collegians, until they disbanded in 1928. He then joined Jay Whidden's band as a pianist and arranger. In 1930, he became director of light music for Parlophone, later extended to cover the other EMI labels, HMV, Regal Zonophone, and Columbia. He reportedly made more recordings than any other musician during the 1930s, sometimes anonymously or under a pseudonym, and in many cases arranging and leading orchestras behind such stars as Richard Tauber, Al Bowlly, Harry Lauder, Beatrice Lillie, Gracie Fields and Ivor Novello. He also recorded with the New Mayfair Dance Orchestra after its leader, Ray Noble, left for the U.S. in 1934, and established his own small jazz group, the Six Swingers. The band released over 50 recordings for the Regal Zonophone and Columbia labels in the 1930s, and in 1938 topped the \"Daily Mail\" readers' poll as radio entertainers.  Scott-Wood also established himself as a leading exponent of the piano accordion. He is credited with introducing the instrument to Britain, and in 1930 published the first comprehensive accordion tutorial book. He regularly played the accordion to accompany tango dances, and in 1934 became musical director of the London Accordion Band before forming his own Accordion Band later in the decade. Initially the band featured nine accordion players, later reduced to four with Scott-Wood on piano and others on bass, drums, guitar, and Hawaiian guitar.  Between 1943 and 1947 Scott-Wood performed mainly as a solo pianist, touring widely in Britain and visiting a wide range of military camps, theatres and factories during the Second World War and afterwards. Later, he resumed regular radio broadcasting with his Accordion Band, and regularly featured on the popular series \"Music While You Work\", both as a bandleader and as a pianist.  He re-formed the Six Swingers in 1950, but the group could not match its former success, and he failed to persuade the Light Entertainment Department of the BBC either that he should adopt a fashionably Italian name (along the lines of Geraldo and Primo Scala), or set up a 23-piece theatre band based around his accordion band. However, in 1957 the BBC agreed that he form a seven-piece ensemble, George Scott-Wood and His Music, which included three accordions, and which continued to make regular radio appearances until the late 1960s. Scott-Wood was a prolific composer of light music, including \"Shy Serenade\", \"Dainty Debutante\", and \"Flying Scotsman\". He was married, with two children.
