Scarlett had emigrated from England and stated in a 1691 court that he had lived in Stafford County for more than 30 years, which record survived because the case had been appealed to the General Court in Williamsburg.  His plantation, which he called \"Deep Hole\" because of an artesian spring, was near the confluence of the Potomac River and Occoquan Creek, near both Belmont Bay and Marumsco Creek, not far from where Captain John Smith landed on one of his Potomac expeditions and which was frequented by Native peoples. That area split from Stafford County to become Prince William County in 1731, well after his death. Around 1655, Scarlett purchased 700 acres from the widow of Thomas Burbage of Nansemond County (who had remarried to Capt. Edward Streator). Then, in 1666, Scarlett and Richard Normansell patented 2,550 acres on what later would be called Mason Neck north of that confluence, in what split from Prince William County and became Fairfax County, Virginia about a decade after the split from Stafford County. In 1674, the Stafford County court divided the parcel (using Pohick Creek as the dividing line between Normanstone's and Scarlett's shares); Scarlett sold all but 320 acres of his share, along Pohick Creek, to George Mason on 10 March 1690. Around 1675/6, Scarlet had married a widow, Ann Green (widow of William Greene Jr., who was affiliated with Lawrence who rebelled in Bacon's Rebellion), and in his lifetime had given half his Deep Hole farm to his stepson Joseph Green. Ann Green Scarlett also had two daughters: Anne who married Edward Barton, and Lettice married Edward Smith (and had 3 children before being widowed) then remarried around 1695 to Burr Harrison (1668\u20131715). Anne Green Scarlett bequeathed the 740 acre Deep Hole property to her son Joshua Green in October 1696, and the rest of the former Normansell property to Edward Barton. When Joshua Green died childless, the property passed to Lettice Green Smith Harrison, who died probably in 1699, since Harrison petitioned the Stafford Court to become the guardian of his late wife's three children. In 1765 Lettice's great grandson John Hancock sold the property to Col. John Tayloe. Early in the 20th century, while the house had long vanished, the family' graveyard remained near the end of Dawson's Beach Road, about two miles from the former ferry at \"Woodbridge\" in what eventually became the Occoquan Bay National Wildlife Refuge.The Works Progress Administration noted gravestones for Scarlett and a relation with a mostly illegible name which referenced a 1698 death date. While the original historian thought the next most legible name was \"John\", modern archeologists believe that it was for his widow (\"relict\") since it mentioned a marriage as well as the 1698 death date, and no records indicate that Martin and Ann had any children together. In 1902 tombstones from the graveyard desecrated during the Civil War were found at the mouth of Occoquan Creek. By this time the farm had been acquired by John Lindsay Dawson (1877 to 1967) of Fairfax County, who raised cattle and wheat and operated a fishery, and used the two tombstones to delineate the corners of his farm on Occoquan and Marumsco Creeks. In 1950 the Department of the Army purchased 648.61 acres known as Deep Hole farm, and built the Woodbridge Research Facility (a/k/a/ Harry Diamond Lab), which was transferred to the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service in the early 2002.

He was the first Black president of the Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) a HBU in Virginia, from 1949 to 1959; a former Commissioner of Education and of Welfare in the Virgin Islands; and a former deputy regional director of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in San Juan, Puerto Rico. \n\n## Early life and education\n\n Alonzo Graseano Brown was born April 12, 1909, in Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, Danish Virgin Islands (now United States Virgin Islands). He and his sibling were primarily raised by their single mother, Caroline Louisa Brown. In 1917, the island became a territory of the United States, but there were not many educational opportunities. In 1923 at age 14, he left the island to attend a secondary vocational school and learn the trade of upholstery at Hampton's Academy in Virginia, a school affiliated with Hampton Institute (now Hampton University). He continued his studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where he graduated with a B.A. degree (1932) in sociology and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. While attending college, he changed his surname to his father's surname of Mor\u00f3n. In 1932, he married Leola \"Lee\" Rowena Churchill from Farnham, Virginia. They never had children. With the Rosenwald Fellowship starting in 1944, he was able to attend Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts; and he received a L.L.B. (1947). In 1950, Wilberforce University awarded him an honorary law degree (L.L.D.). \n\n## Career\n\n The National Urban League provided Mor\u00f3n with a scholarship to study at the University of Pittsburgh, where he received a master's degree (1933) in social work. After graduation he worked as a case worker at the Baltimore's Emergency Relief Commission briefly, where he was the first Black employee. Followed by working for Paul Martin Pearson, the first civilian governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. While working for Pearson, Mor\u00f3n was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the role of Commissioner of Education and of Welfare in the Virgin Islands, serving from 1933 to 1936. Mor\u00f3n had a very close relationship with educator John Hope, who had urged him to enroll in a training institution for housing management and offered him support. In 1936, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia to serve as the assistant administrator of the acting president Florence Read of Atlanta University (now Clark Atlanta University). While living in Atlanta, he managed a 675-unit housing project apartment building; he managed the John Hope Homes (or University Homes); and lectured on housing issues at Atlanta University. While he was still attending law school, he worked as a business management consultant for Hampton Institute, a historically Black university in Virginia. He had been the acting president of Hampton starting in April 1949, and moved up to the role of president in October 1949. Mor\u00f3n was the first Black president of Hampton University, serving from 1949 to 1959. During his time at Hampton Institute, the school was admitted to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Mor\u00f3n resigned as president due to issue with the school's Board of Trustees; they had rejected Mor\u00f3n's proposals for university fundraising, and the board had violated proper channels of administrative rule over grievances with faculty and students, happening during the period right before the civil rights movement. After leaving Hampton Institute in 1959, he moved with his family to St. Thomas. He served as the deputy regional director of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in San Juan, Puerto Rico from until his death in 1971. \n\n## Death and legacy\n\n Mor\u00f3n died on October 31, 1971, in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Moron\" (University of Illinois Press, 2007) by Hoda M. Zaki\".\"", "Geometric Origami": "Geometric Origami is a book on the mathematics of paper folding, focusing on the ability to simulate and extend classical straightedge and compass constructions using origami. It was written by Austrian mathematician and published by Arbelos Publishing (Shipley, UK) in 2008. The Basic Library List Committee of the Mathematical Association of America has suggested its inclusion in undergraduate mathematics libraries. \n\n## Topics\n\n The book is divided into two main parts. The first part is more theoretical. It outlines the Huzita\u2013Hatori axioms for mathematical origami, and proves that they are capable of simulating any straightedge and compass construction. It goes on to show that, in this mathematical model, origami is strictly more powerful than straightedge and compass: with origami, it is possible to solve any cubic equation or quartic equation. In particular, origami methods can be used to trisect angles, and for doubling the cube, two problems that have been proven to have no exact solution using only straightedge and compass. The second part of the book focuses on folding instructions for constructing regular polygons using origami, and on finding the largest copy of a given regular polygon that can be constructed within a given square sheet of origami paper. With straightedge and compass, it is only possible to exactly construct regular for which formula_1 is a product of a power of two with distinct Fermat primes (powers of two plus one): this allows formula_1 to be 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc. These are called the constructible polygons. With a construction system that can trisect angles, such as mathematical origami, more numbers of sides are possible, using Pierpont primes in place of Fermat primes, including for formula_1 equal to 7, 13, 14, 17, 19, etc. \"Geometric Origami\" provides explicit folding instructions for 15 different regular polygons, including those with 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17, and 19 sides. Additionally, it discusses approximate constructions for polygons that cannot be constructed exactly in this way. \n\n## Audience and reception\n\n This book is quite technical, aimed more at mathematicians than at amateur origami enthusiasts looking for folding instructions for origami artworks. However, it may be of interest to origami designers, looking for methods to incorporate folding patterns for regular polygons into their designs. Origamist David Raynor suggests that its methods could also be useful in constructing templates from which to cut out clean unfolded pieces of paper in the shape of the regular polygons that it discusses, for use in origami models that use these polygons as a starting shape instead of the traditional square paper. \"Geometric Origami\" may also be useful as teaching material for university-level geometry and abstract algebra, or for undergraduate research projects extending those subjects, although reviewer Mary Fortune cautions that \"there is much preliminary material to be covered\" before a student would be ready for such a project. Reviewer Georg Gunther summarizes the book as \"a delightful addition to a wonderful corner of mathematics where art and geometry meet\", recommending it as a reference for \"anyone with a working knowledge of elementary geometry, algebra, and the geometry of complex numbers\".", "Planet Fun": "Planet Fun may refer to:", "Qataraspis": "Qataraspis (meaning \"Qatar shield\") is an extinct genus of primitive arthrodire placoderm from the Late?

Mani believed that the teachings of Gautama Buddha, Zarathustra, and Jesus were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the \"Religion of Light\".  Manichaeism considers Zarathustra to be a figure in a line of prophets of which Mani (216\u2013276) was the culmination. Zarathustra's ethical dualism is\u2014to an extent\u2014incorporated in Mani's doctrine, which views the world as being locked in an epic battle between opposing forces of good and evil. Manicheanism also incorporates other elements of Zoroastrian tradition, particularly the names of supernatural beings; however, many of these other Zoroastrian elements are either not part of Zarathustra's own teachings or are used quite differently from how they are used in Zoroastrianism. Manichaeism claims to present the complete version of teachings that had been corrupted and misinterpreted by the followers of its predecessors Adam, Zarathustra, Buddha and Jesus. Accordingly, as it spread, it adapted new deities from other religions into forms it could use for its scriptures. Its original Aramaic texts already contain stories of Jesus. \n\n## Usage of Zoroastrian theoynms\n\n When they moved eastward and were translated into Iranian languages, the names of the Manichaean deities (or angels) were often transformed into the names of Zoroastrian yazatas. Thus \"Abb\u0101 d\u0259Rabb\u016b\u1e6f\u0101\" (\"The Father of Greatness\", the highest Manichaean deity of Light), in Middle Persian texts might either be translated literally as \"p\u012bd \u012b wuzurg\u012bh\", or substituted with the name of the deity \"Zurw\u0101n\". Similarly, the Manichaean primal figure \"N\u0101\u0161\u0101 Qa\u1e0fm\u0101y\u0101\" \"The Original Man\" was rendered \"Ohrmazd Bay\", after the Zoroastrian god Ohrmazd. This process continued in Manichaeism's meeting with Chinese Buddhism, where, for example, the original Aramaic \"qary\u0101\" (the \"call\" from the World of Light to those seeking rescue from the World of Darkness), becomes identified in the Chinese scriptures with Guanyin ( or Avalokite\u015bvara in Sanskrit, literally, \"watching/perceiving sounds [of the world]\", the bodhisattva of Compassion). The original six Syriac writings are not preserved, although their Syriac names have been. There are also fragments and quotations from them. A long quotation, preserved by the eighth-century Nestorian Christian author Theodore Bar Konai, shows that in the original Syriac Aramaic writings of Mani there was no influence of Iranian or Zoroastrian terms. The terms for the Manichaean deities in the original Syriac writings are in Aramaic. The adaptation of Manichaeism to the Zoroastrian religion appears to have begun in Mani's lifetime however, with his writing of the Middle Persian \"Shabuhragan\", his book dedicated to the Sasanian emperor, Shapur I. In it, there are mentions of Zoroastrian divinities such as Ahura Mazda, Angra Mainyu, and \u0100z. Manichaeism is often presented as a Persian religion, mostly due to the vast number of Middle Persian, Parthian, and Sogdian (as well as Turkish) texts discovered by German researchers near Turpan in what is now Xinjiang, China, during the early 1900s. However, from the vantage point of its original Syriac descriptions (as quoted by Theodore Bar Khonai and outlined above), Manichaeism may be better described as a unique phenomenon of Aramaic Babylonia, occurring in proximity to two other new Aramaic religious phenomena, Talmudic Judaism and Mandaeism, which also appeared in Babylonia in roughly the third century.", "Abid el gassad": "Abid el gassad () is a 1962 film directed by Kamal Attia and starring Huda Sultan, Farid Shawqi, Mahmoud Al Meleji, Tawfik El Deken, and Shafik Nour El Din. \n\n## Plot\n\n The film revolves around Abd al-Fattah, who steals a bag of money belonging to \"Uncle Amin\" while he is outside a shop where the saleswoman \"Samia\" works.

More generally, the local elections were held during an escalating wave of crime and violence across Ecuador, linked by many sources to the growing influence of drug trafficking activities in the country, which was one of the issues President Lasso had originally aimed to tackle via the aforementioned constitutional referendum.

In the field of sociology, she pioneered the study of race relations as the theme of her master's thesis in 1945. \n\n## Early life\n\n Virg\u00ednia was born in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1910. She was the daughter of Italian immigrant Giovanna Leone and the descendant of enslaved Black men Theophilo Bicudo. Giovanna was the babysitter of the raised daughter of colonel and senator Bento Augusto de Almeida Bicudo, Theophilo's godfather. With the support of Colonel Bicudo, Theophilo became an employee of the Correios and Tel\u00e9grafos, and later rose in the institution until he reached the position of director of a S\u00e3o Paulo branch. Virg\u00ednia studied at the Escola Normal Caetano de Campos, in the Luz neighborhood. After the Normal School, she took a course on sanitary education at the Hygiene Institute of S\u00e3o Paulo, in 1932. After graduating, she became an employee of the School Health Service Board of the Education Department, teaching hygiene classes in schools in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, where she became interested in Sociology. She started a course in Social Sciences at the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Pol\u00edtica in 1936 \n\n## Sociologist\n\n She received her bachelor's degree in Political and Social Sciences from the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Pol\u00edtica on March 1, 1939. In 1945 she earned a master's degree in sociology from the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Pol\u00edtica, defending the dissertation \"Estudo de atitudes raciais de pretos e mulatos em S\u00e3o Paulo\",\u00a0the first post-graduate work in Social Sciences in Brazil to deal with race relations. Her dissertation was recently republished and has as merit the refusal of racial formulations of biological nature to think of race as a social category. Virg\u00ednia Leone Bicudo verified that racial discrimination in Brazil was not only present in social relations, but it acquired a specific character: it configured a prejudice that minimized direct confrontation and prevented the development of consciousness about discrimination. Her study defends the thesis that the criterion of appearance based on whitening would constitute the main determinant of the opportunities for social ascension of Blacks in Brazil. She was a participant of the UNESCO Project in Brazil, coordinated by Roger Bastide and Florestan Fernandes, writing the report \"Attitudes of the students of the school groups in relation to the color of their colleagues\", published in 1953, in the periodical Anhembi, She was one of the first black female university professors in Brazil, teaching at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Santa Casa, and the Free School of Sociology and Politics. \n\n## Psychoanalist\n\n Virg\u00ednia Bicudo was the first psychoanalyst without medical training in Brazil. She began her analysis with Dr. Adelheid Lucy Koch, the first analyst accredited by the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) in Brazil. In 1937, she applied to become a member of the Brazilian Society of Psychoanalysis of S\u00e3o Paulo (SBPSP), being approved as an effective member in 1945. In 1962, she was elected president of the second board of the Psychoanalysis Institute, a position she would hold until 1975. In 1970, she began to analyze and teach a group of six psychiatrists in Bras\u00edlia (Caiuby de Azevedo Marques Trench, Humberto Haydt de Souza Mello, Ronaldo Mendes de Oliveira Castro, Tito N\u00edcias Rodrigues Teixeira da Silva and Luiz Meyer). The group was then taken over by the Psychoanalytic Society of S\u00e3o Paulo, becoming the first group of the current Psychoanalytic Society of Bras\u00edlia. Virg\u00ednia Bicudo worked in several ways for the diffusion of psychoanalysis in Brazil. She wrote columns in the press defending her ideas on the social function of the psychoanalyst and took part in the foundation of the Psychoanalysis Society of Brasilia. She also collaborated in the creation of the Revista Brasileira de Psican\u00e1lise (RBP).

Widely used in industry and academia, it has become a standard approach for describing complex mixtures. Since it was first proposed in 1990, SAFT has been used in a large number of molecular-based equation of state models for describing the Helmholtz energy contribution due to association. \n\n## Overview\n\n SAFT is a Helmholtz energy term that can be used in equations of state that describe the thermodynamic and phase equilibrium properties of pure fluids and fluid mixtures. SAFT was developed using statistical mechanics. SAFT models the Helmholtz free energy contribution due to association, i.e. hydrogen bonding. SAFT can be used in combination with other Helmholtz free energy terms. Other Helmholtz energy contributions consider for example Lennard-Jones interactions, covalent chain-forming bonds, and association (interactions between segments caused by, for example, hydrogen bonding). SAFT has been applied to a wide range of fluids, including supercritical fluids, polymers, liquid crystals, electrolytes, surfactant solutions, and refrigerants. \n\n## Development\n\n SAFT evolved from thermodynamic theories, including perturbation theories developed in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s by John Barker and Douglas Henderson, Keith Gubbins and Chris Gray, and, in particular, Michael Wertheim's first-order, thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT1) outlined in a series of papers in the 1980s.  SAFT was originally proposed in a 1990 paper titled \"New reference equation of state for associating liquids\" by Walter Chapman, Keith Gubbins, George Jackson, and Maciej Radosz, which, in 2007, was recognized by \"Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research\" as one of the most highly cited papers of the previous three decades. SAFT improved on earlier, over-simplified theories, which were based on hard spherical molecules that do not associate, by focusing on molecular chain length and association. \n\n## Variations\n\n Many variations of SAFT have been developed since the 1990s, including HR-SAFT (Huang-Radosz SAFT), PC-SAFT (perturbed chain SAFT), PCP-SAFT (polar PC-SAFT), soft-SAFT, polar soft-SAFT, SAFT-VR (variable range), SAFT VR-Mie. Also, the SAFT term was used in combination with cubic equations of state for describing the dispersive-repulsive interactions, for example in the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) equation of state model and the SAFT + cubic model and non-random-lattice (NLF) models based on lattice field theory.", "Molla Mehmet Karay\u0131lan": "Molla Mehmet Karay\u0131lan (1888 - 24 May 1920) was a Kurdish villager who famously fought and died in the Siege of Aintab. \n\n## Early life\n\n Mehmet was born in 1888 in a tent in the Elifler or K\u00fcrt Elif hamlet in the Besni kaza, Ottoman Empire, modern-day Pazarc\u0131k, Turkey, to a relatively affluent family belonging to the Kabalar sub-tribe of the Kurdish Atma or Reshwan tribe. His father, Mahmut, was a skillful fighter, earning him the nickname \"Karay\u0131lan\" ( \"black snake\"), which Mehmet inherited. In 1904, his father was killed by Armenian bandits raiding the hamlet.  Mehmet took Quran lessons from the imam of the S\u00f6\u011f\u00fctl\u00fc village in modern-day Malatya Province and became the imam of his own village. Because of this, he came to be known as \"Molla\". \n\n## World War I\n\n Molla Mehmet fought against Russia for the Ottomans during World War I and got injured on his leg. After healing, he became the leader of his tribe. He collaborated with the Ottoman government to track down and kill the infamous bandit Bozan Agha, who terrorized the region between Pazarc\u0131k and Malatya. \n\n## Participation in the Siege of Aintab and death\n\n Upon hearing of the French expansion to Aintab, Molla Mehmet gathered 82 volunteers from his tribe and sold his family property, against his mother\u2019s wish for him to stay. Defeating French forces marching towards Marash in Karab\u0131y\u0131kl\u0131 village, Mehmet was able to capture 50 French soldiers, which earned him great fame throughout Turkey.

", "Palace Carminali Bottigella": "Palace Carminali Bottigella is a noble palace built by the ancient Beccaria family from Pavia. The original structure from the Sforza era was built between 1490 and 1499. The fa\u00e7ade, which retains the original terracotta decorations, is one of the major examples of Renaissance civil building in Pavia. \n\n## History\n\n The first owners of the building were the Beccarias, who at least from 1348 held a fair amount of real estate in the Porta Marenga district. In 1695 the building was purchased by Giovanni and Flavio Carminali, a family of noble merchants from Bergamo, who had been present in the city since the second half of the 16th century. The Carminals moved their home here from their previous residence in Piazza Vittoria near the Church of Santa Maria Gualtieri. The new owners promoted important extension works of the house. The large Baroque staircase with two flights, adhering to the east side of the building, in fact bears the date 1696 engraved on the central pillar of the balustrade, adorned with 18 coats of arms. In 1763 the palace passed, by will of Pier Francesco Carminati, to his cousins Ottavio and Francesco Malaspina Giorgi di Sannazzaro and, in 1784, it was sold to Monsignor Antonio Picchiotti, the bishop's vicar, who in turn left it to his nephew Baldassarre Bottigella. In 1866, the residence was inherited by the Vicos and, after becoming the headquarters of the Casa del Fascio, in 1946 it passed to the Provincial Association of Merchants. \n\n## Architecture\n\n As regards its construction, attributions to Bramante and Giovanni Antonio Amadeo have been hypothesized. Some notarial deeds drawn up between 1491 and 1496 testify that in those years Andrea Beccaria and his brothers paid some Milanese stonecutters, Alessandro Bossi and Domenico Solari, then engaged in the reconstruction of the family's domus magna, and therefore probable that the current palace it replaced a previous stately home of the family (of which the tower remains, leaning against the western part of the facade, now trimmed and reduced to the same height as the building). The works for the construction of the building were however directed by the ducal engineer Martino Fugazza. The facade overlooking Corso Cavour is entirely in brick and was not completed, however, what exists is sufficiently indicative of the intentions of the designer. The surface, extended to two floors above ground plus one under the eaves, remained entirely in exposed brick, is divided into two parts by the large string course in terracotta, decorated with plant motifs with interspersed coats of arms and profiles of characters marked by a typically Renaissance taste. This string course is ideally supported by terracotta pilasters with marble capitals on the ground floor. And in turn it holds as many candelabra-columns, always in terracotta. Each of the backgrounds thus obtained (which perhaps originally should have been plastered) was intended to house a window, surrounded by a frame, surmounted by a decoration with fauns and bucrania, also in terracotta. However, only the two at the left end of the ground floor were completed, while on the first floor both the size and the arched shape that can be read in the traces of the original openings would suggest the intention of placing mullioned windows. This party can in part recall others belonging to palaces in the Po Valley but not in Pavia: above all Palazzo Mozzanica in Lodi and Palazzo Landi in Piacenza, both of which have a similar horizontal band dividing the lower area from the upper part, but have neither pilasters or candelabra-columns. The interiors were extensively remodeled between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and retain Baroque stuccos and frescoes, while in the middle of the great staircase, the fifteenth-century funerary slabs of members of the Bottigella family from the church San Tommaso are preserved.", "Hawley Hospital": "The Hawley Hospital was a specialist hospital in Barnstaple, Devon, founded in 1920 as a pulmonary tuberculosis sanatorium as part of a network of such facilities, instigated by the Public Health (Tuberculosis Regulations) 1912. \n\n## History\n\n The hospital was set up to take tuberculosis (TB) patients in the North Devon area, and was administratively linked to the Hawkmoor County Sanatorium near Bovey Tracey, with the building complete in 1920. Staff shortages in 1946 led to a restriction on the admission of patients, and led the Devon Public Health Committee to consider its closure. It joined the NHS in 1948, and was placed in to the Exeter Special Hospital Management Committee, which looked after the specialist TB, smallpox, and isolation hospitals. In 1949, 23 patients were admitted and 17 discharged, with two patients dying and 2 being transferred to other hospitals. The hospital was closed on 31 March 1963, with all patients and future treatment transferred to Hawkmoor Hospital. \n\n## Location\n\n The hospital was located on Sowden Lane, to the East of the centre of Barnstaple.

Sure, we hear that familiar Br\u00f6tzmann plaintive cry throughout, but the rhythms delivered by Drake and Gania are so mesmerizing... that this live date takes on a hypnotic atmosphere.\" Eyal Hareuveni of \"The Free Jazz Collective\" noted \"the tension between Br\u00f6tzmann's spectrum of contemplative, sometimes even lyrical playing and his wild swings and the one-dimensional, repetitive and trance-like rhythm section,\" and praised passages where the saxophonist's \"wailing answers cleverly the vocal phrases of Gania and often pushes the interplay to intense, ecstatic terrains.\" Critic Tom Hull awarded the album an \"A\u2013\", and stated that Gania \"centers this album, the jazz greats working around him, but also providing him with edges that lift him way above the merely exotic.\" Writing for \"The Wire\", Peter Margasak commented: \"the... partnership delivers magically shifting and embroidering grooves, digging into twangy, cycling patterns, and achieving a trance-inducing ecstasy where spontaneity feels preternatural.\" Phil Freeman of \"Burning Ambulance\" remarked: \"Br\u00f6tzmann is in a questing mood, emitting long rattling cries like a phlegmatic bull and only occasionally erupting into full-on screams. The music rises and falls like ocean waves or ripples in desert sand, seeming to have no beginning or end.\" However, he noted that \"Mokhtar simply lacks the aggressiveness [his brother] Mahmoud possessed.\" A reviewer for \"Avant Music News\" called the album \"a tuneful and challenging set of songs and improvisations,\" and wrote: \"Thumbs way up.\" \n\n## Track listing\n\n Music by Hamid Drake, Mokhtar Gania, and Peter Br\u00f6tzmann", "J\u00f6rgen Berglund": "J\u00f6rgen Berglund (born 1974) is a Swedish politician. he serves as Member of the Riksdag representing the constituency of V\u00e4sternorrland County.
