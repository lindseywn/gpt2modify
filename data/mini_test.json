Scarlett had emigrated from England and stated in a 1691 court that he had lived in Stafford County for more than 30 years, which record survived because the case had been appealed to the General Court in Williamsburg.  His plantation, which he called \"Deep Hole\" because of an artesian spring, was near the confluence of the Potomac River and Occoquan Creek, near both Belmont Bay and Marumsco Creek, not far from where Captain John Smith landed on one of his Potomac expeditions and which was frequented by Native peoples. That area split from Stafford County to become Prince William County in 1731, well after his death. Around 1655, Scarlett purchased 700 acres from the widow of Thomas Burbage of Nansemond County (who had remarried to Capt. Edward Streator). Then, in 1666, Scarlett and Richard Normansell patented 2,550 acres on what later would be called Mason Neck north of that confluence, in what split from Prince William County and became Fairfax County, Virginia about a decade after the split from Stafford County. In 1674, the Stafford County court divided the parcel (using Pohick Creek as the dividing line between Normanstone's and Scarlett's shares); Scarlett sold all but 320 acres of his share, along Pohick Creek, to George Mason on 10 March 1690. Around 1675/6, Scarlet had married a widow, Ann Green (widow of William Greene Jr., who was affiliated with Lawrence who rebelled in Bacon's Rebellion), and in his lifetime had given half his Deep Hole farm to his stepson Joseph Green. Ann Green Scarlett also had two daughters: Anne who married Edward Barton, and Lettice married Edward Smith (and had 3 children before being widowed) then remarried around 1695 to Burr Harrison (1668\u20131715). Anne Green Scarlett bequeathed the 740 acre Deep Hole property to her son Joshua Green in October 1696, and the rest of the former Normansell property to Edward Barton. When Joshua Green died childless, the property passed to Lettice Green Smith Harrison, who died probably in 1699, since Harrison petitioned the Stafford Court to become the guardian of his late wife's three children. In 1765 Lettice's great grandson John Hancock sold the property to Col. John Tayloe. Early in the 20th century, while the house had long vanished, the family' graveyard remained near the end of Dawson's Beach Road, about two miles from the former ferry at \"Woodbridge\" in what eventually became the Occoquan Bay National Wildlife Refuge.The Works Progress Administration noted gravestones for Scarlett and a relation with a mostly illegible name which referenced a 1698 death date. While the original historian thought the next most legible name was \"John\", modern archeologists believe that it was for his widow (\"relict\") since it mentioned a marriage as well as the 1698 death date, and no records indicate that Martin and Ann had any children together. In 1902 tombstones from the graveyard desecrated during the Civil War were found at the mouth of Occoquan Creek. By this time the farm had been acquired by John Lindsay Dawson (1877 to 1967) of Fairfax County, who raised cattle and wheat and operated a fishery, and used the two tombstones to delineate the corners of his farm on Occoquan and Marumsco Creeks. In 1950 the Department of the Army purchased 648.61 acres known as Deep Hole farm, and built the Woodbridge Research Facility (a/k/a/ Harry Diamond Lab), which was transferred to the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service in the early 2002.

He was the first Black president of the Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) a HBU in Virginia, from 1949 to 1959; a former Commissioner of Education and of Welfare in the Virgin Islands; and a former deputy regional director of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in San Juan, Puerto Rico. \n\n## Early life and education\n\n Alonzo Graseano Brown was born April 12, 1909, in Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, Danish Virgin Islands (now United States Virgin Islands). He and his sibling were primarily raised by their single mother, Caroline Louisa Brown. In 1917, the island became a territory of the United States, but there were not many educational opportunities. In 1923 at age 14, he left the island to attend a secondary vocational school and learn the trade of upholstery at Hampton's Academy in Virginia, a school affiliated with Hampton Institute (now Hampton University). He continued his studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where he graduated with a B.A. degree (1932) in sociology and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. While attending college, he changed his surname to his father's surname of Mor\u00f3n. In 1932, he married Leola \"Lee\" Rowena Churchill from Farnham, Virginia. They never had children. With the Rosenwald Fellowship starting in 1944, he was able to attend Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts; and he received a L.L.B. (1947). In 1950, Wilberforce University awarded him an honorary law degree (L.L.D.). \n\n## Career\n\n The National Urban League provided Mor\u00f3n with a scholarship to study at the University of Pittsburgh, where he received a master's degree (1933) in social work. After graduation he worked as a case worker at the Baltimore's Emergency Relief Commission briefly, where he was the first Black employee. Followed by working for Paul Martin Pearson, the first civilian governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. While working for Pearson, Mor\u00f3n was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the role of Commissioner of Education and of Welfare in the Virgin Islands, serving from 1933 to 1936. Mor\u00f3n had a very close relationship with educator John Hope, who had urged him to enroll in a training institution for housing management and offered him support. In 1936, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia to serve as the assistant administrator of the acting president Florence Read of Atlanta University (now Clark Atlanta University). While living in Atlanta, he managed a 675-unit housing project apartment building; he managed the John Hope Homes (or University Homes); and lectured on housing issues at Atlanta University. While he was still attending law school, he worked as a business management consultant for Hampton Institute, a historically Black university in Virginia. He had been the acting president of Hampton starting in April 1949, and moved up to the role of president in October 1949. Mor\u00f3n was the first Black president of Hampton University, serving from 1949 to 1959. During his time at Hampton Institute, the school was admitted to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Mor\u00f3n resigned as president due to issue with the school's Board of Trustees; they had rejected Mor\u00f3n's proposals for university fundraising, and the board had violated proper channels of administrative rule over grievances with faculty and students, happening during the period right before the civil rights movement. After leaving Hampton Institute in 1959, he moved with his family to St. Thomas. He served as the deputy regional director of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in San Juan, Puerto Rico from until his death in 1971. \n\n## Death and legacy\n\n Mor\u00f3n died on October 31, 1971, in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Moron\" (University of Illinois Press, 2007) by Hoda M. Zaki\".\"", "Geometric Origami": "Geometric Origami is a book on the mathematics of paper folding, focusing on the ability to simulate and extend classical straightedge and compass constructions using origami. It was written by Austrian mathematician and published by Arbelos Publishing (Shipley, UK) in 2008. The Basic Library List Committee of the Mathematical Association of America has suggested its inclusion in undergraduate mathematics libraries. \n\n## Topics\n\n The book is divided into two main parts. The first part is more theoretical. It outlines the Huzita\u2013Hatori axioms for mathematical origami, and proves that they are capable of simulating any straightedge and compass construction. It goes on to show that, in this mathematical model, origami is strictly more powerful than straightedge and compass: with origami, it is possible to solve any cubic equation or quartic equation. In particular, origami methods can be used to trisect angles, and for doubling the cube, two problems that have been proven to have no exact solution using only straightedge and compass. The second part of the book focuses on folding instructions for constructing regular polygons using origami, and on finding the largest copy of a given regular polygon that can be constructed within a given square sheet of origami paper. With straightedge and compass, it is only possible to exactly construct regular for which formula_1 is a product of a power of two with distinct Fermat primes (powers of two plus one): this allows formula_1 to be 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc. These are called the constructible polygons. With a construction system that can trisect angles, such as mathematical origami, more numbers of sides are possible, using Pierpont primes in place of Fermat primes, including for formula_1 equal to 7, 13, 14, 17, 19, etc. \"Geometric Origami\" provides explicit folding instructions for 15 different regular polygons, including those with 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17, and 19 sides. Additionally, it discusses approximate constructions for polygons that cannot be constructed exactly in this way. \n\n## Audience and reception\n\n This book is quite technical, aimed more at mathematicians than at amateur origami enthusiasts looking for folding instructions for origami artworks. However, it may be of interest to origami designers, looking for methods to incorporate folding patterns for regular polygons into their designs. Origamist David Raynor suggests that its methods could also be useful in constructing templates from which to cut out clean unfolded pieces of paper in the shape of the regular polygons that it discusses, for use in origami models that use these polygons as a starting shape instead of the traditional square paper. \"Geometric Origami\" may also be useful as teaching material for university-level geometry and abstract algebra, or for undergraduate research projects extending those subjects, although reviewer Mary Fortune cautions that \"there is much preliminary material to be covered\" before a student would be ready for such a project. Reviewer Georg Gunther summarizes the book as \"a delightful addition to a wonderful corner of mathematics where art and geometry meet\", recommending it as a reference for \"anyone with a working knowledge of elementary geometry, algebra, and the geometry of complex numbers\".", "Planet Fun": "Planet Fun may refer to:", "Qataraspis": "Qataraspis (meaning \"Qatar shield\") is an extinct genus of primitive arthrodire placoderm from the Late?

Mani believed that the teachings of Gautama Buddha, Zarathustra, and Jesus were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the \"Religion of Light\".  Manichaeism considers Zarathustra to be a figure in a line of prophets of which Mani (216\u2013276) was the culmination. Zarathustra's ethical dualism is\u2014to an extent\u2014incorporated in Mani's doctrine, which views the world as being locked in an epic battle between opposing forces of good and evil. Manicheanism also incorporates other elements of Zoroastrian tradition, particularly the names of supernatural beings; however, many of these other Zoroastrian elements are either not part of Zarathustra's own teachings or are used quite differently from how they are used in Zoroastrianism. Manichaeism claims to present the complete version of teachings that had been corrupted and misinterpreted by the followers of its predecessors Adam, Zarathustra, Buddha and Jesus. Accordingly, as it spread, it adapted new deities from other religions into forms it could use for its scriptures. Its original Aramaic texts already contain stories of Jesus. \n\n## Usage of Zoroastrian theoynms\n\n When they moved eastward and were translated into Iranian languages, the names of the Manichaean deities (or angels) were often transformed into the names of Zoroastrian yazatas. Thus \"Abb\u0101 d\u0259Rabb\u016b\u1e6f\u0101\" (\"The Father of Greatness\", the highest Manichaean deity of Light), in Middle Persian texts might either be translated literally as \"p\u012bd \u012b wuzurg\u012bh\", or substituted with the name of the deity \"Zurw\u0101n\". Similarly, the Manichaean primal figure \"N\u0101\u0161\u0101 Qa\u1e0fm\u0101y\u0101\" \"The Original Man\" was rendered \"Ohrmazd Bay\", after the Zoroastrian god Ohrmazd. This process continued in Manichaeism's meeting with Chinese Buddhism, where, for example, the original Aramaic \"qary\u0101\" (the \"call\" from the World of Light to those seeking rescue from the World of Darkness), becomes identified in the Chinese scriptures with Guanyin ( or Avalokite\u015bvara in Sanskrit, literally, \"watching/perceiving sounds [of the world]\", the bodhisattva of Compassion). The original six Syriac writings are not preserved, although their Syriac names have been. There are also fragments and quotations from them. A long quotation, preserved by the eighth-century Nestorian Christian author Theodore Bar Konai, shows that in the original Syriac Aramaic writings of Mani there was no influence of Iranian or Zoroastrian terms. The terms for the Manichaean deities in the original Syriac writings are in Aramaic. The adaptation of Manichaeism to the Zoroastrian religion appears to have begun in Mani's lifetime however, with his writing of the Middle Persian \"Shabuhragan\", his book dedicated to the Sasanian emperor, Shapur I. In it, there are mentions of Zoroastrian divinities such as Ahura Mazda, Angra Mainyu, and \u0100z. Manichaeism is often presented as a Persian religion, mostly due to the vast number of Middle Persian, Parthian, and Sogdian (as well as Turkish) texts discovered by German researchers near Turpan in what is now Xinjiang, China, during the early 1900s. However, from the vantage point of its original Syriac descriptions (as quoted by Theodore Bar Khonai and outlined above), Manichaeism may be better described as a unique phenomenon of Aramaic Babylonia, occurring in proximity to two other new Aramaic religious phenomena, Talmudic Judaism and Mandaeism, which also appeared in Babylonia in roughly the third century.", "Abid el gassad": "Abid el gassad () is a 1962 film directed by Kamal Attia and starring Huda Sultan, Farid Shawqi, Mahmoud Al Meleji, Tawfik El Deken, and Shafik Nour El Din. \n\n## Plot\n\n The film revolves around Abd al-Fattah, who steals a bag of money belonging to \"Uncle Amin\" while he is outside a shop where the saleswoman \"Samia\" works.

More generally, the local elections were held during an escalating wave of crime and violence across Ecuador, linked by many sources to the growing influence of drug trafficking activities in the country, which was one of the issues President Lasso had originally aimed to tackle via the aforementioned constitutional referendum.

In the field of sociology, she pioneered the study of race relations as the theme of her master's thesis in 1945. \n\n## Early life\n\n Virg\u00ednia was born in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1910. She was the daughter of Italian immigrant Giovanna Leone and the descendant of enslaved Black men Theophilo Bicudo. Giovanna was the babysitter of the raised daughter of colonel and senator Bento Augusto de Almeida Bicudo, Theophilo's godfather. With the support of Colonel Bicudo, Theophilo became an employee of the Correios and Tel\u00e9grafos, and later rose in the institution until he reached the position of director of a S\u00e3o Paulo branch. Virg\u00ednia studied at the Escola Normal Caetano de Campos, in the Luz neighborhood. After the Normal School, she took a course on sanitary education at the Hygiene Institute of S\u00e3o Paulo, in 1932. After graduating, she became an employee of the School Health Service Board of the Education Department, teaching hygiene classes in schools in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, where she became interested in Sociology. She started a course in Social Sciences at the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Pol\u00edtica in 1936 \n\n## Sociologist\n\n She received her bachelor's degree in Political and Social Sciences from the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Pol\u00edtica on March 1, 1939. In 1945 she earned a master's degree in sociology from the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Pol\u00edtica, defending the dissertation \"Estudo de atitudes raciais de pretos e mulatos em S\u00e3o Paulo\",\u00a0the first post-graduate work in Social Sciences in Brazil to deal with race relations. Her dissertation was recently republished and has as merit the refusal of racial formulations of biological nature to think of race as a social category. Virg\u00ednia Leone Bicudo verified that racial discrimination in Brazil was not only present in social relations, but it acquired a specific character: it configured a prejudice that minimized direct confrontation and prevented the development of consciousness about discrimination. Her study defends the thesis that the criterion of appearance based on whitening would constitute the main determinant of the opportunities for social ascension of Blacks in Brazil. She was a participant of the UNESCO Project in Brazil, coordinated by Roger Bastide and Florestan Fernandes, writing the report \"Attitudes of the students of the school groups in relation to the color of their colleagues\", published in 1953, in the periodical Anhembi, She was one of the first black female university professors in Brazil, teaching at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Santa Casa, and the Free School of Sociology and Politics. \n\n## Psychoanalist\n\n Virg\u00ednia Bicudo was the first psychoanalyst without medical training in Brazil. She began her analysis with Dr. Adelheid Lucy Koch, the first analyst accredited by the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) in Brazil. In 1937, she applied to become a member of the Brazilian Society of Psychoanalysis of S\u00e3o Paulo (SBPSP), being approved as an effective member in 1945. In 1962, she was elected president of the second board of the Psychoanalysis Institute, a position she would hold until 1975. In 1970, she began to analyze and teach a group of six psychiatrists in Bras\u00edlia (Caiuby de Azevedo Marques Trench, Humberto Haydt de Souza Mello, Ronaldo Mendes de Oliveira Castro, Tito N\u00edcias Rodrigues Teixeira da Silva and Luiz Meyer). The group was then taken over by the Psychoanalytic Society of S\u00e3o Paulo, becoming the first group of the current Psychoanalytic Society of Bras\u00edlia. Virg\u00ednia Bicudo worked in several ways for the diffusion of psychoanalysis in Brazil. She wrote columns in the press defending her ideas on the social function of the psychoanalyst and took part in the foundation of the Psychoanalysis Society of Brasilia. She also collaborated in the creation of the Revista Brasileira de Psican\u00e1lise (RBP).

Widely used in industry and academia, it has become a standard approach for describing complex mixtures. Since it was first proposed in 1990, SAFT has been used in a large number of molecular-based equation of state models for describing the Helmholtz energy contribution due to association. \n\n## Overview\n\n SAFT is a Helmholtz energy term that can be used in equations of state that describe the thermodynamic and phase equilibrium properties of pure fluids and fluid mixtures. SAFT was developed using statistical mechanics. SAFT models the Helmholtz free energy contribution due to association, i.e. hydrogen bonding. SAFT can be used in combination with other Helmholtz free energy terms. Other Helmholtz energy contributions consider for example Lennard-Jones interactions, covalent chain-forming bonds, and association (interactions between segments caused by, for example, hydrogen bonding). SAFT has been applied to a wide range of fluids, including supercritical fluids, polymers, liquid crystals, electrolytes, surfactant solutions, and refrigerants. \n\n## Development\n\n SAFT evolved from thermodynamic theories, including perturbation theories developed in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s by John Barker and Douglas Henderson, Keith Gubbins and Chris Gray, and, in particular, Michael Wertheim's first-order, thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT1) outlined in a series of papers in the 1980s.  SAFT was originally proposed in a 1990 paper titled \"New reference equation of state for associating liquids\" by Walter Chapman, Keith Gubbins, George Jackson, and Maciej Radosz, which, in 2007, was recognized by \"Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research\" as one of the most highly cited papers of the previous three decades. SAFT improved on earlier, over-simplified theories, which were based on hard spherical molecules that do not associate, by focusing on molecular chain length and association. \n\n## Variations\n\n Many variations of SAFT have been developed since the 1990s, including HR-SAFT (Huang-Radosz SAFT), PC-SAFT (perturbed chain SAFT), PCP-SAFT (polar PC-SAFT), soft-SAFT, polar soft-SAFT, SAFT-VR (variable range), SAFT VR-Mie. Also, the SAFT term was used in combination with cubic equations of state for describing the dispersive-repulsive interactions, for example in the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) equation of state model and the SAFT + cubic model and non-random-lattice (NLF) models based on lattice field theory.", "Molla Mehmet Karay\u0131lan": "Molla Mehmet Karay\u0131lan (1888 - 24 May 1920) was a Kurdish villager who famously fought and died in the Siege of Aintab. \n\n## Early life\n\n Mehmet was born in 1888 in a tent in the Elifler or K\u00fcrt Elif hamlet in the Besni kaza, Ottoman Empire, modern-day Pazarc\u0131k, Turkey, to a relatively affluent family belonging to the Kabalar sub-tribe of the Kurdish Atma or Reshwan tribe. His father, Mahmut, was a skillful fighter, earning him the nickname \"Karay\u0131lan\" ( \"black snake\"), which Mehmet inherited. In 1904, his father was killed by Armenian bandits raiding the hamlet.  Mehmet took Quran lessons from the imam of the S\u00f6\u011f\u00fctl\u00fc village in modern-day Malatya Province and became the imam of his own village. Because of this, he came to be known as \"Molla\". \n\n## World War I\n\n Molla Mehmet fought against Russia for the Ottomans during World War I and got injured on his leg. After healing, he became the leader of his tribe. He collaborated with the Ottoman government to track down and kill the infamous bandit Bozan Agha, who terrorized the region between Pazarc\u0131k and Malatya. \n\n## Participation in the Siege of Aintab and death\n\n Upon hearing of the French expansion to Aintab, Molla Mehmet gathered 82 volunteers from his tribe and sold his family property, against his mother\u2019s wish for him to stay. Defeating French forces marching towards Marash in Karab\u0131y\u0131kl\u0131 village, Mehmet was able to capture 50 French soldiers, which earned him great fame throughout Turkey.

", "Palace Carminali Bottigella": "Palace Carminali Bottigella is a noble palace built by the ancient Beccaria family from Pavia. The original structure from the Sforza era was built between 1490 and 1499. The fa\u00e7ade, which retains the original terracotta decorations, is one of the major examples of Renaissance civil building in Pavia. \n\n## History\n\n The first owners of the building were the Beccarias, who at least from 1348 held a fair amount of real estate in the Porta Marenga district. In 1695 the building was purchased by Giovanni and Flavio Carminali, a family of noble merchants from Bergamo, who had been present in the city since the second half of the 16th century. The Carminals moved their home here from their previous residence in Piazza Vittoria near the Church of Santa Maria Gualtieri. The new owners promoted important extension works of the house. The large Baroque staircase with two flights, adhering to the east side of the building, in fact bears the date 1696 engraved on the central pillar of the balustrade, adorned with 18 coats of arms. In 1763 the palace passed, by will of Pier Francesco Carminati, to his cousins Ottavio and Francesco Malaspina Giorgi di Sannazzaro and, in 1784, it was sold to Monsignor Antonio Picchiotti, the bishop's vicar, who in turn left it to his nephew Baldassarre Bottigella. In 1866, the residence was inherited by the Vicos and, after becoming the headquarters of the Casa del Fascio, in 1946 it passed to the Provincial Association of Merchants. \n\n## Architecture\n\n As regards its construction, attributions to Bramante and Giovanni Antonio Amadeo have been hypothesized. Some notarial deeds drawn up between 1491 and 1496 testify that in those years Andrea Beccaria and his brothers paid some Milanese stonecutters, Alessandro Bossi and Domenico Solari, then engaged in the reconstruction of the family's domus magna, and therefore probable that the current palace it replaced a previous stately home of the family (of which the tower remains, leaning against the western part of the facade, now trimmed and reduced to the same height as the building). The works for the construction of the building were however directed by the ducal engineer Martino Fugazza. The facade overlooking Corso Cavour is entirely in brick and was not completed, however, what exists is sufficiently indicative of the intentions of the designer. The surface, extended to two floors above ground plus one under the eaves, remained entirely in exposed brick, is divided into two parts by the large string course in terracotta, decorated with plant motifs with interspersed coats of arms and profiles of characters marked by a typically Renaissance taste. This string course is ideally supported by terracotta pilasters with marble capitals on the ground floor. And in turn it holds as many candelabra-columns, always in terracotta. Each of the backgrounds thus obtained (which perhaps originally should have been plastered) was intended to house a window, surrounded by a frame, surmounted by a decoration with fauns and bucrania, also in terracotta. However, only the two at the left end of the ground floor were completed, while on the first floor both the size and the arched shape that can be read in the traces of the original openings would suggest the intention of placing mullioned windows. This party can in part recall others belonging to palaces in the Po Valley but not in Pavia: above all Palazzo Mozzanica in Lodi and Palazzo Landi in Piacenza, both of which have a similar horizontal band dividing the lower area from the upper part, but have neither pilasters or candelabra-columns. The interiors were extensively remodeled between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and retain Baroque stuccos and frescoes, while in the middle of the great staircase, the fifteenth-century funerary slabs of members of the Bottigella family from the church San Tommaso are preserved.", "Hawley Hospital": "The Hawley Hospital was a specialist hospital in Barnstaple, Devon, founded in 1920 as a pulmonary tuberculosis sanatorium as part of a network of such facilities, instigated by the Public Health (Tuberculosis Regulations) 1912. \n\n## History\n\n The hospital was set up to take tuberculosis (TB) patients in the North Devon area, and was administratively linked to the Hawkmoor County Sanatorium near Bovey Tracey, with the building complete in 1920. Staff shortages in 1946 led to a restriction on the admission of patients, and led the Devon Public Health Committee to consider its closure. It joined the NHS in 1948, and was placed in to the Exeter Special Hospital Management Committee, which looked after the specialist TB, smallpox, and isolation hospitals. In 1949, 23 patients were admitted and 17 discharged, with two patients dying and 2 being transferred to other hospitals. The hospital was closed on 31 March 1963, with all patients and future treatment transferred to Hawkmoor Hospital. \n\n## Location\n\n The hospital was located on Sowden Lane, to the East of the centre of Barnstaple.

Sure, we hear that familiar Br\u00f6tzmann plaintive cry throughout, but the rhythms delivered by Drake and Gania are so mesmerizing... that this live date takes on a hypnotic atmosphere.\" Eyal Hareuveni of \"The Free Jazz Collective\" noted \"the tension between Br\u00f6tzmann's spectrum of contemplative, sometimes even lyrical playing and his wild swings and the one-dimensional, repetitive and trance-like rhythm section,\" and praised passages where the saxophonist's \"wailing answers cleverly the vocal phrases of Gania and often pushes the interplay to intense, ecstatic terrains.\" Critic Tom Hull awarded the album an \"A\u2013\", and stated that Gania \"centers this album, the jazz greats working around him, but also providing him with edges that lift him way above the merely exotic.\" Writing for \"The Wire\", Peter Margasak commented: \"the... partnership delivers magically shifting and embroidering grooves, digging into twangy, cycling patterns, and achieving a trance-inducing ecstasy where spontaneity feels preternatural.\" Phil Freeman of \"Burning Ambulance\" remarked: \"Br\u00f6tzmann is in a questing mood, emitting long rattling cries like a phlegmatic bull and only occasionally erupting into full-on screams. The music rises and falls like ocean waves or ripples in desert sand, seeming to have no beginning or end.\" However, he noted that \"Mokhtar simply lacks the aggressiveness [his brother] Mahmoud possessed.\" A reviewer for \"Avant Music News\" called the album \"a tuneful and challenging set of songs and improvisations,\" and wrote: \"Thumbs way up.\" \n\n## Track listing\n\n Music by Hamid Drake, Mokhtar Gania, and Peter Br\u00f6tzmann", "J\u00f6rgen Berglund": "J\u00f6rgen Berglund (born 1974) is a Swedish politician. he serves as Member of the Riksdag representing the constituency of V\u00e4sternorrland County.

She was the financier and confidant of Giuseppe Mazzini and promulgator of Mazzini's ideas and works. \n\n## Life\n\n Nathan was born in Pesaro in 1819. Her parents were Ricca Rosselli and Angelo Levi. At the age of eleven her mother died and she was entrusted to two ladies in Modena to complete her education. To avoid her conversion to Catholicism, she was then sent by her father to her maternal relatives in Livorno, a city that allowed a freedom of worship to Jews. Here, she met Meyer Moses Nathan, a German-born Jewish stockbroker who lived in London. They married, moved to London and became British citizens by 1837.  She met Giuseppe Mazzini in London in 1837 during his exile. She was attracted by his revolutionary and anti-monarchist ideas. In 1848, she began exchanging letters with Mazzini and she became his confidante. Her husband started a penny subscription scheme from his work contacts and 200 subscribed. An intermediary between the two was Pellegrino Rosselli, cousin of Sara and friend of Mazzini. He would later marry her daughter. The death of her husband in 1859 brought her a substantial inheritance which allowed her to finance Mazzini and his insurrectional activities. She returned to Italy with her daughter Janet as she needed a warmer climate. Dissatisfied with the monarchical outcome of unification, she acted as intermediary between Mazzini and Garibaldi in the hope that the country could become a republica as Mazzini desired. In a letter written to Garibaldi on 19 August 1862, she said that \"the homeland is safe if the two men whom Italy loves and esteems above all are united.\" She was charged with conspiracy. To avoid arrest, she and her daughter fled to Lugano, where in August 1865 she bought the villa \"La Tanzina\" which hosted, in addition to Mazzini, other Italians such as Cattaneo, Bertani and Quadrio. Mazzini stayed in the villa until 1871, the year in which she returned to Italy under a pseudonym and moved to Pisa in the house of Janet/Giannetta Rosselli, Sara's daughter. In March 1872, Sara Levi Nathan went to the house of the Rossellis in Pisa, where Mazzini was dying. Mazzini died in the Roselli's house.  At Mazzini's funeral, Sara took care of the coffin together with Aurelio Saffi's wife. In the following months she dealt with the publication of the works and all the writings of the republican patriot, purchasing all the manuscripts and all the rights to writings and works. In Rome, she founded the Unione benefica, a shelter to prevent the spread of prostitution and a secular girls' school in Trastevere and for this reason the target of criticism from many Catholics. \n\n## Life and legacy\n\n Nathan died in London in 1882 after surgery. She was buried in the in Rome where a memorial celebrates her and members of her family. In 1907 her son Ernesto Nathan was elected to be the mayor of Rome.

The opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU) declined to 43.2% and remained steady on 95 seats. The SPD's majority was ensured by the failure of the FDP to re-enter parliament: they fell just short of the 5% electoral threshold and lost all their seats.

Her father was set to become a Catholic priest but instead decided to move west with the Indians and work for the American Fur Company. Sophies mother and father died in the summer of 1851 when she was around 8 years old. Sophie and her two younger sisters were brought to the Iowa and Sac &amp; Fox Mission. The oldest two sisters walked to the mission on foot with the youngest being carried by a missionary. Sophie quickly adhered to the Christian faith being taught to her at the mission by Samuel M. Irvin and was quite devout until her death. Her health started to decline sometime after 1855 until her confirmed diagnosis of Consumption (disease) that would eventually take her in 1861. \n\n## Death\n\n On her death bed she spoke extensively about her fate to those who were attending to her in her final moments including her sisters. \"...I am done with the world; I am ready to go... I am going very soon, and I want all to be quiet and the room to be still and no one to cry or make a noise, that I may go quietly away and be at rest.\" In her final moments fighting against death, she spoke of band playing from the village even after being told that no such event was happening. \"Is not the village band playing this evening?... I hear delightful music... it is delightful, listen... I have now lost the use of one of my hands (it was cold in death) but if I could use it, I would raise it and clap both my hands for joy.\" in her last breath she spoke of Jesus coming to raise her up from the earth and then laid lifeless on the bed after the remark. \"Jesus is coming--they are coming--raise me up.\" It seems that Sophie knew of her demise far before the actual event by verses found in her bible cover that she had written before she bed ridden (shown below).&lt;blockquote&gt;\"Worlds should not bribe me back to tread Again Life's weary waste To see again my days o'erspread With all the gloomy past. \"My home henceforth is in the skies, Earth, sea, and sun adieu All heaven unfolded to my eyes, I have no sight for you.\"&lt;/blockquote&gt; \n\n## Sophie\u2019s contribution\n\n Before Sophie\u2019s death, she had 200 dollars that she had saved up from dividends from the tribe and those funds were deposited into a savings bank and trust in St. Joseph, Missouri.

Before obtaining the name \"Rubeti Hall\" it was often referred to as \"The Boarding house\" and the \"Indian Home\". Rubeti Hall was a girl's dorm until 1964 when it was converted to a boy's dorm and then was demolished in 1978 in order to build Culbertson Auditorium. Bricks from the fireplace of the dorm were used in a memorial outside of Irvin Hall in remembrance of the 110-year-old building that was razed and the girl it was named after. The memorial however does not use any of the beforementioned names opting for the name \"Rubeti Lodge\". \n\n## Sophie\u2019s ghost\n\n Whilst in use Rubeti hall was said to be haunted with residents claiming to hear sounds of disembodied footsteps and scraping chairs on the vacant 3rd floor.

As leader of the monastic order, he largely focused on internal matters, leaving foreign policy to Konrad von Wallenrode, who was appointed Marshal of the Order and Komtur of Konigsberg. He reformed the administrative structure of Teutonic Prussia, promoted German settlement, and attempted to found a university in the city of Kulm, though the latter never came to fruition. He also, like his predecessor, combated usery, reducing the maximuim interest rate from 10% to 8.33%, with violators having their capital confiscated. The city of Passenheim was granted city rights in 1386. During Konrad's reign, tensions between the Teutonic Order and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania escalated. Attempts to christianize Lithuania (which was one of the few areas in Europe that remained pagan) in 1383 failed, and although Lithuania adopted Christianity in 1386, relations only soured more as the baptism of Grand Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o was done to facilitate the marriage between him and the Queen of Poland, Jadwiga. This meant that Lithuania and Poland, who was the primary rival of the Teutonic Order, had entered into a personal union. In his later reign, the order was beset by numerous internal issues; in 1383, a plague outbreak occurred, and in later years, crop failures, and declining fishing and trade output wrecked havoc upon the state. Konrad died in Christburg on August 20, 1390. His body was buried in the Marienburg castle in the mausoleum of grandmaster under the chapel of St. Anne.", "\u0160luota": "\u0160luota (literally \"broom\") was a Lithuanian satire and humour magazine which was published, with hiatuses, from 1934 to 2004. Until 1990, it was published by the Communist Party of Lithuania and contained mainly Communist propaganda. It was the only humour magazine in the Lithuanian SSR and it was popular and well received. According to research of Neringa Klumbyt\u0117, artists and writers attempted to subvert the Communist ideology using the Aesopian language in the 1970s and 1980s. \n\n## History\n\n In 1934\u20131936, \"\u0160luota\" was published by the Lithuanian Communist Party. Since the party was outlawed in the interwar Lithuania, the publication was also illegal and appeared irregularly. The magazine was initiated by a group of students at the Kaunas Art School who maintained contacts with the Lithuanian Red Aid. The first issue had 16 pages and measured . A total of seven issues appeared during this period.  In 1940\u20131941, during the first Soviet occupation of Lithuania, it was published by the Soviet Agitprop and later by the \"Tiesa\" (\"Truth\") publishing house. It is suggested that the long post-World War II hiatus was related to the death of its editor, , who restored the magazine in 1940 and no one else had the energy to convince the Communist officials to restore it again. Until 1941, the magazine was published in Kaunas.  In 1956\u20131990, \"\u0160luota\" was published by the publishers of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Lithuanian SSR in Vilnius. It was a popular, well-liked, and profitable 16-page magazine published every two weeks. After the restoration of the independence of Lithuania, it was published by the company \u0160luota in 1990\u20131998 and by the company Piketo projektai in 2000\u20132004. In 1995, it was reorganized as a monthly newspaper. \n\n## Content\n\n The magazine published satirical, humorous writings, jokes and cartoons and caricatures on social, political, cultural and household topics. One or its recurring joke characters is Kindziulis.  The title of the journal reflected its revolutionary origins. It symbolized the intent to sweep away bourgeoisie, capitalists, clerics, etc. in a communist revolution. Issues published in 1940\u20131941 made fun of various \"enemies of the people\" and representatives of the old regime of President Antanas Smetona, including speculators, landlords, intellectuals, and bureaucrats. It also pointed out common problems of everyday life (such as laziness, wastefulness, alcoholism) and celebrated the new regime and building the new socialist society. Issues published after 1956 no longer focused on external enemies (i.e. bourgeoisie), but turned the satire inward and pointed out flaws of the Soviet society. The cast of characters now included drunk and procrastinating workers, Soviet bureaucrats, directors of factories and collective farms, but not party or government officials. \"\u0160luota\" received numerous letters from readers that complained or reported on various disapproved actions (such as alcoholism). In 1963, the office of correspondence received 2,234 letters, 230 of which were published.  \"\u0160luota\" devoted a third to a half of its content to cartoons and other illustrations. In the 1970s and 1980s there were around sixty artists who contributed to the magazine on somewhat regular basis. The artists were not members of the Communist Party and generally avoided contributing political or anti-religious cartoons despite higher commissions. Since it was easier to be ambiguous in a cartoon than in written text, some cartoons could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. For example, a cartoon of a tank aiming at the white peace dove could be interpreted as depicting either an American or Soviet tank. An ambiguous image printed as the cover for Lenin's 100th anniversary resulted in the entire issue being destroyed. Neringa Klumbyt\u0117 characterized such subversive actions as \"neither an example of clear collaboration, nor of open resistance, but rather a close interaction with power through dialogue, negotiation, acceptance, and rejection\". \n\n## Editors\n\n Magazines editors were:", "Kot Addu District": "Kot Addu District () is a district in the Punjab province of Pakistan.

By 1786, he had built a large house here. The acreage had increased to by 1798. After his death in 1812, the property was divided and passed through several owners. In 1872, David Dunham Withers, active in the horse racing industry, bought for his Brookdale Stable. In 1893, William Payne Thompson purchased the property. His son, Lewis, married Geraldine Morgan Thompson in 1896.

The district has 19 contributing buildings and one contributing site. Thomas Lloyd built his Georgian house in 1786. It was renovated and expanded in Colonial Revival style by Harry Whitney in 1914. The Lloyd Barn was likely built in the 18th century. It was later upgraded by Geraldine Thompson. The two-story Ten Mare Barn was likely built by David Withers in 1883.

It contains a single species, M. serbicus. \n\n## History\n\n The specimen was collected from Bela Stena, Suseoke village. The binomial nomenclature for \"Miodytes serbicus\" means \"Serbian Miocene diver\". \n\n## Description\n\n The holotype specimen of \"Miodytes\" is a slab that contains the right wing skeleton of the bird, nearly completed, consisting of the distal fragment of humerus, ulna, radius, carpometacarpus and parts of the wingtips (RGF 97/3). Due to the nature of the bones in the slab, the authors Dimitreijevich et al. (2002) used the humerus part and the carpometacarpus to provide comparative anatomy and a diagnosis. \"Miodytes\" can be differentiated from other grebes as the genus has a well developed epicondylus ventralis and a very deep and long sulcus musculi brachialis. The processus supracondylaris dorsalis is absent from the humerus. There are elements that are similar to grebes, petrels, and shorebirds from the specimen in which the authors proclaimed of the three groups, \"Miodytes\" is most similar to grebes. \n\n## Classification\n\n While Dimitreijevich et al. (2002) classifies \"Miodytes\" as a grebe, Ksepka et al. (2013) do not agree with the assessment. They are argued the diagnostic features that separate \"Miodytes\" from other grebes are more align with other seabirds. They stated there is no unambiguous synapomorphies that can confidently identify \"Miodytes\" as a grebe. Ksepka et al. (2013) argued at best \"Miodytes\" is a member of Mirandornithes, as it does have a strongly elongate phalanx II-1 which lacks an internal indicus process. More specimens are needed to established the taxonomic placement of this bird. \n\n## Paleobiology\n\n \"Miodytes\" is from the Early Miocene from the \"Bela Stena series\" from Valjevo Basin. The site is the oldest recorded lake formation with records of plant and insect remains, fish bones, and feathers. Fragmentary bird fossils have been retrieved but most cannot be identified at the species level. Inferring from the ecology of modern grebes and how the specimen was preserved, Dimitreijevich et al. (2002) suggested \"Miodytes\" was a migratory species and the individual died from an accident, not predation.", "Yelesen, Bing\u00f6l": "Yelesen () is a village in the Bing\u00f6l District, Bing\u00f6l Province, Turkey.

She graduated from Simmons University, where she studied political science, in 2011. \n\n## Historical interpretation\n\n McKnight works as a historical interpreter at locations such as Colonial Williamsburg, Genesee Country Village and Museum, Historic Richmond Town, and Museum of the American Revolution to teach people about the lives of African Americans in American history, particularly during the 18th and 19th centuries. She also works with museums and their staff to create resources and improve staff's ability to educate visitors on slavery and African American history. McKnight is a member of the New York Historical Society. McKnight began interpreting in 2013. Her first event was a reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg, where she portrayed a 22-year old free woman. As she began participating in more events, she became disappointed with how African Americans were portrayed or discussed, often only in relation to who owned them rather than their own internal lives and experiences. In 2014, in response to these experiences, McKnight founded Not Your Momma's History, which offered workshops of her own making for museums and schools. In 2017 McKnight officially began working solely on Not Your Momma's History. That same year, she staged a reoccurring work of performance art in Manhattan called #SlaveryMadePlain, during which she held a sign saying \u201cWhat to a Slave Is the Fourth of July\u201d while wearing historical dress. In 2019 McKnight was included in the book \"The American Duchess Guide to 18th Century Beauty\", where she spoke on enslaved people's dress and hair. In November 2020 McKnight dressed as an enslaved mother and stood outside the U.S. Capitol to call attention both to how emancipated African Americans struggled to find their relatives after the Civil War, and the separation of families at the United State's southern border. In 2021 McKnight was chosen as an African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund Fellow by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. As part of this, she created a project titled \"The Ancestor\u2019s Future: An Afrofuturist Journey Through History\", which was staged at the Woodlawn &amp; Pope-Leighey House as \"both a piece of performance art and a conversation inspired by Afrofuturism\". In 2022 McKnight set up a portable table in different locations in New York City a few times a month, and encouraged passersby to speak to her and ask questions about slavery and its history in the city.

It is distinct for its creeping growth habit and the prickles that grow on the flowering stems, which resemble a ladder. The specific epithet \"scalarium\" refers to the Latin word for \"ladder\". \"S. scalarium\" is a perennial spreading decumbent pale green shrub up to 30\u00a0cm tall. The main stem can grow between 4\u201312\u00a0cm tall, is woody and may branch 2\u20134 times. Younger stems yellow-green to tan-green in color and older woody stems eventually becoming dark tan or gray.

After a decade-long delay in his trial, he pleaded guilty to his confirmed crimes and was sentenced to life imprisonment, but remains the prime suspect in at least one additional murder. \n\n## Early life\n\n Little is known about Hobbs' past. Born in 1971 in Crosby, Texas, he is said to have come from a reputable family, but was considered a loner who mostly kept to himself. After graduating from college, he married, had two children and held a job as a security guard for a firm in Houston, where he still worked at the time of his arrest. He had no criminal record, but in 2000, he had been detained in the county jail for a couple of hours for a traffic violation. \n\n## Crimes\n\n Although investigators suspect Hobbs of crimes dating back to 1996, the first case he has definitively been linked occurred in August 2002. At that time, he picked up a prostitute in Houston and paid her to perform oral sex, but instead proceeded to rape, beat and violently choke her. This assault took place off the Beaumont Highway, near the San Jacinto River, where the victim was left behind. A couple of months later, he abducted 38-year-old prostitute Patricia Ann Pyatt from her home in Crosby, drove to an isolated area, then raped and strangled her to death. Her remains were found on November 19, beneath the Beaumont Highway bridge. A lull in known attacks then occurred from the rest of 2002 until 2010, when Hobbs is known to have assaulted a prostitute named Sandra Gunter near Houston. In October of that year, the nude body of 48-year-old Sarah Annette Sanford was found in a wooded area near his home. She had been handcuffed, sexually assaulted and shot in the head. Between June and July 2011, Hobbs is known to have attacked and sexually assaulted at least three prostitutes at gunpoint in and around Houston. On September 22, an officer from Pasadena who stopped by a brushy road to clock the speed of passing cars accidentally found the decomposing remains of 57-year-old prostitute Wanda Trombley, who had been reported missing in July. \n\n## Arrest, imprisonment and guilty plea\n\n The discovery of Trombley's body led local authorities to start questioning prostitutes, some of whom alleged that they had been assaulted by a large, red-headed white male wearing thick eyeglasses and a security guard uniform. Using this information, officers ordered all men who worked as security guards in the county to submit DNA samples, including Hobbs. This eventually linked him to the sexual assaults and then the murders of Pyatt and Sanford. The gap between the crimes led investigators to re-investigate the murders of at least 15 prostitutes around Harris County and the surrounding areas, as they believed that Hobbs was responsible for more crimes than what he had been linked to. Despite this and the fact that he was a prime suspect in the Trombley murder, no further charges were filed against him. Almost ten years would elapse before Hobbs would be put on trial - this was due to multiple delays caused by the search for reliable witnesses, damage from Hurricane Katrina and debates on whether he should face the death penalty. In 2020, the Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg announced that she would not be seeking the death penalty against Hobbs, but the reason for this decision has never been revealed. In May 2022, just days before he was due to stand trial, Hobbs pleaded guilty to all charges and was automatically sentenced to life terms with a chance of parole after serving at least 50 years, meaning that he could be paroled aged 101. The reason for this decision was supposedly remorse for his crimes and encouragement from his family. At the time, he was second-longest serving inmate in Harris County, being detained for only a slightly shorter time than another murderer, Lucky Ward. As of January 2023, Hobbs is detained at the Ramsey Unit in Rosharon.", "Lenehan": "Lenehan is a given name and a surname which may refer to:", "Neil Kearney": "Neil Joseph Kearney (15 March 1950 \u2013 19 November 2009) was an Irish trade union leader.

He was a prominent vocal critic of Buddhist nationalism, the military and military-backed organizations and businesses. He faced legal action in 2019 as a result of his public criticism of the military. \n\n## Life and movements\n\n The sayadaw was born in 1951 in Myingyan, Mandalay Region, Burma. He had entered monkhood after finishing high school with outstanding grades. At the age of 26, he earned the prestigious title of Buddhist scholar, a remarkable achievement that only 11 other monks accomplished in the entire 20th century. Myawaddy Sayadaw was known for his active participation in interfaith activities across Myanmar, often collaborating with Cardinal Charles Maung Bo. Alongside other influential Buddhist leaders in Myanmar, he participated in a meeting with Pope Francis to discuss interfaith relations during his visit to the country in November 2017. He has worked with peace and interfaith groups in Mandalay and with the National League for Democracy. In 2019, he was sued by the army for criticizing military donations of roughly 30 million kyats to the Buddhist nationalist organisation Ma Ba Tha, claiming that the military was sponsoring ultranationalist monks preaching hatred. He criticized the military, referring to them as \"robbers and thieves\", alleging that they disobeyed the president's orders, abused their power by intimidating civilians with their weapons, and unconstitutionally occupied parliamentary seats without an election. He also denounced Ashin Wirathu, a leading nationalist Buddhist monk, saying, \"He sides a little towards hate [and this was] not the way Buddha taught.

The Brawley took the form of a classic all-electric four-wheel all-terrain vehicle for a change. The vehicle is equipped with an extensive suspension system that allows for competitive driving on off-road, which is facilitated by 18-inch alloy wheels equipped with 35-inch tires with a thick profile and deep tread. It has a glazed roof and doors, from which the upper part of the body can be optionally removed. The minimalistic styled passenger compartment is distinguished by a triple arrangement of analogue clocks as well as a series of switches in the center console. Following the example of other models of the company, the steering wheel gained a three-spoke form. Production and sales of the Brawley was scheduled to begin in 2022, with reservations being collected just after the debut in July 2021.

It chronicles the life of J Dilla until his death in 2006, as well as his posthumous influence on the music industry. Described as \"equal parts biography, musicology, and cultural history,\" the book emphasizes J Dilla's signature rhythmic time-feel, which Charnas termed \"Dilla time,\" and its wide-reaching impact on modern music. The book debuted on \"The New York Times\" Best Sellers list, receiving widespread acclaim from critics and musicians. \n\n## Background\n\n In 1999, writer Dan Charnas met J Dilla and Common while the two musicians were working on Common's album \"Like Water for Chocolate\" at J Dilla's home studio in Conant Gardens, Detroit. Charnas cites this meeting as \"the real origin of the book.\" As an associate professor at the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University, Charnas taught a course called \"Topics in Recorded Music: J Dilla\" that discussed J Dilla's musical techniques and influence. He began work researching and reporting for the book in 2017. Charnas interviewed over 200 friends, family members, and collaborators of J Dilla throughout the research process. In the book, Charnas aims to dispel several myths about J Dilla. For one, according to Charnas, many musicians reduce J Dilla's time-feel as simply \"loose\" and \"not quantizing,\" but the book describes this as an oversimplification, detailing the nuances that defined J Dilla's technique. The book also debunks the misconception that J Dilla produced his 2006 album \"Donuts\" in the hospital, instead explaining that the album was born from an earlier beat tape and edited by Jeff Jank of Stones Throw Records while J Dilla was in the hospital. \n\n## Cover artwork\n\n \"Dilla Time\"'s cover artwork was designed by Rodrigo Corral. \"The New York Times\" listed it as one of the best book covers of 2022, calling it \"an image that signals the zones of [J Dilla's] many talents while nodding to the relationship between that talent and work ethic (and beats),\" also noting the exclusion of Charnas' name from the cover. \n\n## Reception\n\n \"Dilla Time\" was released to widespread critical acclaim, debuting at number four on the \"The New York Times\" Hardcover Nonfiction Best Sellers list. \"Pitchfork\" called \"Dilla Time\" \"easily the best rap book of the year,\" describing the book as \"not only a love letter to Dilla, but also a riveting immersion into the music of Detroit and the art of beatmaking.\" \"Rolling Stone\" listed the book as one of the best music books of 2022, describing it as \"elegantly written and deeply sourced.\" Writing for \"Spin\", Liza Lentini praised the book, calling it \"a portrait of a complex genius taken too young, as well as a glorious study of the music and culture he created.\" At the 2023 PEN Awards, \"Dilla Time\" won the PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for Biography. \n\n## Film adaptation\n\n On September 22, 2022, it was announced that Questlove would executive produce a feature documentary titled \"Dilla Time\", adapted from the book. The film will be co-directed by Joseph Patel, who produced \"Summer of Soul\" with Questlove, and Darby Wheeler. The film will be produced in cooperation with J Dilla's estate, with Dan Charnas also serving as producer.

His period as director of Aston Villa was fraught with problems and boardroom battles for power, most notably with Doug Ellis. Although there were major successes on the pitch under manager Ron Saunders during his tenure, in which the club won the First Division title in season 1980-81 and European Cup in season 1981-82, Bendall's regime was beset by controversy. He introduced his son, Donald to the board, and amid cries of nepotism Sir William Dugdale, Alan Smith and Harry Cressman resigned in protest. This was then followed by a power struggle with Doug Ellis and Eric Houghton. This boardroom struggle was eventually won by the Bendall's who bought out the Ellis shares in 1979 to give them a 42% holding in the club. To the surprise of commentators and fans, Ron Saunders quit halfway through the 1981\u201382 season, with Villa in the quarter final of the European Cup. Saunders had expressed his exasperation with the board at the lack of funds available to him to strengthen the team and fell out with the chairman Ron Bendall over the terms of his contract. Bendall cancelled the managers 'rollover' clause that would guarantee him a three-year pay-off in the event of his being sacked. Saunders was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager Tony Barton who guided the club to a 1\u20130 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam courtesy of a Peter Withe goal in the 67th minute, making Villa only the fourth English club to lift the European Cup. Due to ill-health, Bendall sold his shares back to Doug Ellis in November 1982. The club was saddled with significant debts and questions had been raised by the police regarding fraudulent financial activity surrounding the building of the North Stand at Villa Park from 1980-82. The cost of the work was \u00a31.3\u00a0million. An internal investigation found that \u00a3700,000 of the \u00a31.3\u00a0million worth of bills were unaccounted for.

", "Morgan Grace": "Morgan Grace may refer to:", "Bryconops rheoruber": "Bryconops rheoruber is a species of freshwater fish from the rivers of Brazil. Its back scales are tan-to-cream, and its belly is silvery; the divide between the two colors is marked by a broad iridescent-silver stripe. Its fins are a mixture of pale, clear, and reddish, which contributed to its specific name. \"Rheo\" means \"flow\" or \"current\" in Greek, and \"ruber\" means \"red\" in Latin. It was first described from the rapids of the Rio Xingu (hence \"rheo\" in its scientific name), and its range is known to extend into the Rio Iriri, the largest tributary therein. Like many other species of \"Bryconops\", it prefers fast-flowing waters over a rocky or sandy substrate. \n\n## Description\n\n \"Bryconops rheoruber\" ranges from 4.61 to 5.49 cm in standard length. This makes it smaller than most \"Bryconops\", members of which are largely between 6 and 8 cm long. It is deep-chested, with its deepest body section just before the dorsal fin, and it has 8\u20139 pre-dorsal scales; the latter is a feature it only shares with \"B. marabaixo\" and \"B. chernoffi\". Unlike several other species of \"Bryconops\", \"B. rheoruber\" lacks a humeral spot (a mark near either pectoral fin). Many fish in Bryconops have either one humeral spot or two. \"Bryconops rheoruber\" has a broad, iridescent-silver lateral stripe that turns lead-gray when a deceased specimen is preserved in alcohol. The scales themselves are tan-to-cream dorsally and silver ventrally in life, with all scales turning pale-yellow upon preservation. Some specimens may have an isolated blotch of pigment upon the distal portion of the caudal fin's dorsal lobe; this is superficially similar to coloration seen in congener \"B. florenceae\", though in \"B. florenceae\" the pigmentation is limited to the base of the dorsal lobe and the distal regions are left pale. The other fins are somewhat varied in coloration. The dorsal fin may have a diffuse, red crescent arching backwards from the center of the base to the outer fin-rays, which leaves a half-oval patch of hyaline dorsal fin near the base, and the tip is whitish. The adipose fin is red. The dorsal half of the caudal fin has a diffuse red ocellus (eyespot) near the base, terminating about midway down the lobe, and the tip of both lobes therein is dusky, sometimes with a darkly-pigmented dorsal tip. The anal, pelvic, and pectoral fins are mostly hyaline (clear). \n\n## Sexual dimorphism\n\n Mature males of \"B. rheoruber\" sport bony hooks on the rays of the anal and pelvic fins. These hooks are pointed back towards the body. Many members of \"Bryconops\" display similar hooks or spines, though appearance varies based on species. \n\n## Taxonomy\n\n There are two subgenera in \"Bryconops\", \"Bryconops\" and \"Creatochanes\". \"B. rheoruber\" has been considered a member of subgenus \"Bryconops\" since its description in 2019, based on the fact that its maxillaries lack teeth or have a single conical tooth isolated to either side. Members of \"Creatochanes\" are partially characterized by having one to three teeth on both sides, and also by factors like jaw length and the bones surrounding the eyes. \n\n## Etymology\n\n \"Rheo\" means \"flow\" or \"current\" in Greek, and \"ruber\" means \"red\" in Latin (compare the word \"ruby\"); respectively, these reflect \"B. rheoruber's\" preference for waters with a strong current, and the red coloration prominent in various fins. When originally named, \"B. rheoruber\" was named \"B. rheorubrum\". However, this was changed to be \"rheoruber\" because the genus name \"Bryconops\" is considered masculine by Latin gender rules, and convention states that the species and genus name match genders. \"Rheorubrum\" would be spelled \"rheoruber\" when paired with the masculine genus name. \n\n## Habitat and ecology\n\n \"Bryconops rheoruber\" was originally collected from the clearwater rapids of the Rio Xingu (pronounced sheen-GOO), and is also native to the Rio Iriri, the largest tributary of the Rio Xingu. Its natural habitat classifies it as \"rheophilic\", a word meaning \"living in flowing water or strong current\". This preference for clearwater rapids is demonstrated by other members of \"Bryconops\", even those that are not found in the Xingu. Examples include \"B. piracolina\", from the Igarape Piracolina; \"B. tocantinensis\", from the Rio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o; \"B. caudomaculatus\", from the Orinoco and Amazon River basins; and \"B. magoi\", from the rivers of Venezuela. \n\n## Conservation status\n\n \"Bryconops rheoruber\" has not been evaluated by the IUCN. Nonetheless, there are various factors affecting its surrounding environment that may both help and hinder its survival as a species. The Rio Xingu has been subjected to various infrastructure projects over the years, the most prominent of which was the construction of the Belo Monte Dam, the world's third-largest hydroelectric dam. This significantly altered the flow of the rapids in regions of the Xingu, threatening the environments therein. The establishment of the Xingu Indigenous Park, created in 1961, has helped to protect the territory not only of various endemic fish species, but also of various cultures and peoples that have lived in the area dating back to the 1200s.

(Original description) The shell is very long and slender. It contains about ten rounded whorls. The first two are turbinate, smooth. The third shows ten or twelve close-set vertical riblets, crossed by eight or ten revolving ones, the vertical gradually increasing to twenty-six on the body whorl, forming a close beaded sculpture as far as the middle of body-whorl, while the revolving ribs continue alone on the body to the siphonal canal. It varies also in relative strength of the two series of riblets, at different portions of the spire. The sinus is close to the suture The siphonal canal is straight.

The term \"sinus tarsi syndrome\" can also refer to swelling of the subtalar joint. The condition is somewhat poorly understood. \n\n## Causes\n\n Sinus tarsi syndrome can have a variety of causes, such as: \n\n## Symptoms\n\n Sinus tarsi syndrome is characterized by pain, tenderness, and instability/aggravation of the pain when walking on uneven surfaces or during weight bearing activity. The pain will be also aggravated by inversion (turning in) and eversion (turning out). Looseness of the ankle and foot joints can also occur. There is also often the presence of ligament tears, arthrofibrosis, ganglion cysts, or degeneration of the joints. Occasionally, peroneal spasms, valgus hindfoot, and limited varus motion can also be present. \n\n## Diagnosis\n\n X-ray can show some impingement in the sinus tarsi area. Other diagnostic tests include: bone scans, CT scans, and MRI evaluation. Doctors may inject local anesthetic to localize the problem to the sinus tarsi. Radiopharmaceuticals can also be used to identify inflammation. Ankle arthroscopy may also be used to locate damaged tissue. Diagnosis is often a process of elimination as sinus tarsi syndrome is rarely a definitive disorder. \n\n## Treatment\n\n \n\n## Conservative treatments\n\n Conservative (non-surgical) treatments are often considered first. Possible treatments include: Resistant cases may require more invasive treatments such as: \n\n## Surgical treatments\n\n Surgical treatments are very rare and reserved for highly resistant cases. Surgery can be open (via an incision) or closed (via arthroscopy). In cases of flatfoot, sinus tarsi syndrome is complicated by the collapse of the arches. In these cases, surgery includes debridement (cleaning out) of the sinus tarsi and possible reconstruction of the foot. Surgery can also include debridement of bone spurs as well. \n\n## Prognosis\n\n If treated, sinus tarsi syndrome has an excellent prognosis. Full recovery is to be expected, though some patients will need rehabilitation. However, relapse can occasionally occur, especially if only conservative treatments are undergone. Sinus tarsi syndrome can be misdiagnosed as a chronic ankle sprain. Untreated sinus tarsi syndrome can develop into chronic ankle pain and disability. \n\n## History\n\n Sinus tarsi syndrome was first studied by Dr. Denis O'Connor in 1957. O'Connor claimed conservative treatment was ineffective and surgery was the only effective option, describing a surgery in which the surgeon resects the superficial ligamentous floor and cleans out the fat pad. O'Connor claimed all 14 patients this surgery was performed on reported relief of their symptoms.

The use of concrete (an industrial material) by LeWitt is a recognition of and a reflection of the artwork's urban setting. Several private donors assisted by the High Museum of Art made this gift to the people of Fulton County possible.

The ecoregion extends south from the Bay of All Saints (about 15 degrees south latitude) to Cabo Frio (about 23 degrees south latitude) just east of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The Brazil Current enters from the east, feeding warm subtropical water to the south along the coast. The influence of the tropical waters leaves the ecoregion relatively oligotrophic (nutrient poor). The Eastern Brazil ecoregion is one of two coastal marine ecoregions (along with the Northeastern Brazil marine ecoregion) in the Tropical Southwest Atlantic marine province. It is thus part of the Tropical Atlantic realm. \n\n## Physical setting\n\n The ecoregion reaches out into the Atlantic Ocean for 200\u2013250 miles from the coast. The ecoregion is bounded on the north at the Bay of All Saints, and stretches for 1,000 coastal miles to the south at Cabo Frio, where the ecoregion transitions to the Southeastern Brazil marine ecoregion. The bordering coast is generally low and flat, and characterized by Bahia coastal forests ecoregion, and mangrove forests of the Bahia mangroves ecoregion. The major rivers feeding the Eastern Brazil marine region include the Jequitinhonha, Doce and Para\u00edba do Sul rivers. The continental shelf along this coast of Brazil extends about 30 miles out to sea in the north and south, but 130 miles in the middle. The deepest point in the ecoregion overall is , and the average is . A prominent underwater feature in the middle of the ecoregion is the Albrohos Shelf, a portion of the continental shelf extending 200\u00a0km offshore. Besides supporting extensive coral reef complexes, the Albrohos shelf includes the largest known continuous rhodolith bed in the world, with an estimated area of 20,900 km2. Rhodoliths are calcareous nodules created by Coralline algae, and support diverse benthic communities in a manner similar to shallow coral reefs. Another prominent underwater feature is the east\u2013west trending Vit\u00f3ria-Trindade Seamount Chain (VTC). The seamounts in the ecoregion are known to support high biodiversity in fish species, but are relatively under-explored. The offshore basins of the ecoregion, from north to south, are the Camamu-Almada Basin, the Jequitinhonha Basin, the Cumuruxatiba Basin, the Mucuri Basin, and the Espirito Santo Basin. Oil and gas exploration and production are underway in the northern two basins. \n\n## Currents and climate\n\n The Atlantic South Equatorial Current (SEC) flows directly into the ecoregion from the East, bringing warm water from the South Atlantic Ocean. As the SEC approaches the eastern point of Brazil at Cape S\u00e3o Roque, it splits, with the North Brazil Current (NBC) flowing along the coast to the north and west, and the Brazil Current flowing south along the eastern coast. The Brazil Current is a western boundary current, flowing at a rate averaging 4 Sverdrups (Sv), at a mean speed of . Surface temperatures range from . \n\n## Animals / Fish\n\n Biodiversity of the near-shore areas varies with the influence of the coasts - mangroves, sandbanks, and beaches - and also by the nature of the bottoms, which are reefs, gravel and mud. There are a variety of fish, cetaceans, turtles, shrimps and lobsters. A recent study found 25 species of shark and 9 species of rays. Over 90% of commercial fishing is on the nearshore coast, typically by artisinal (subsistence and traditional) methods. Traditional methods of hook and line fishing, and with gillnets, are employed on small boats seeking drum fish (family \"Sciaenidae\"). Small shrimp trawlers and lobster boats also operate in the coastal waters, with some evidence that use of nets by lobster fishers is causing harm to the bottom for other species. In the south, along Rio de Janeiro state, the artisinal beach fishery uses large canoes and seine nets to catch migrating schools of bluefish, mullets and bonitos. Offshore, the industrial fisheries of the region are mostly employ hook-and-line methods rather than trawlers due to the narrow coastal shelf, rocky bottom, and deep canyons. The commercial fishery is centered on rockfish, sharks and tuna. \n\n## Conservation status\n\n Many of the terrestrial protected areas on the coast have marine components, such that about 8% of the ecoregion is protected, including:  As of 2013, only 2% of the Albrohos Shelf, with its Mesophotic coral reefs, was in a \"no-take\" protected area.", "Cl\u00e9venot": "Cl\u00e9venot is a surname.

He attended Auburn University, where he earned his degree in 1960; he was the first person in his family to attend college. Crutchfield moved to Atlanta, where he worked for the stationery manufacturer Montag, which was later bought by Mead.  In 1971, Crutchfield participated in the development of the ABC television special \"Good Vibrations from Central Park\", which featured the Beach Boys and Carly Simon, but also included pitches for Mead's product line, in a bid to get students to start thinking about school and school supplies. He also earned in-house awards for his product developments Crutchfield had begun to evolve his loose-leaf ring binder \"Trapper Keeper\" in the 1970s, but took his time bringing it to market.

His son and principal heir George Braxton, Jr. also served in the House of Burgesses, but his most notable descendant (who was 12 when this grandfather died) was Carter Braxton, who became a Founding Father of the United States. \n\n## Career\n\n Braxton owned 2825 acres in King and Queen County by 1704. His main plantation was Newington, on the bluffs above the Mattaponi River about 18 miles upstream from West Point, the county seat at the stream's confluence with the York River. He became one of the largest landowners in the Northern Neck of Virginia and probably one of the 100 largest in the colony. He and his namesake son also owned a ship, \"Braxton\", and leased others to carry on a triangular trade with the West Indies and Britain. About once a year, the Braxtonx served as commission agents for cargoes of enslaved Blacks. Braxton accepted the governor's appointment as colonel of the King and Queen county militia, as well as coroner and one of the justices of the peace who collectively administered the county. He probably also served on the vestry of St. Stephen's parish (which also were responsible for care of the poor and disabled), although its records did not survive. King and Queen county voters first elected Braxton as one of their two representatives in the House of Burgesses in 1718, and he served (with a gap) for about three decades. Beginning in 1728, Braxton served alongside John Robinson, who would become the family's major benefactor, although a scandal erupted after his death. Braxton also served on the select committee that assisted the governor in building the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg. \n\n## Personal life\n\n By 1702, Braxton had marreid Elizabeth Pallin, daughter of planter Thomas Paullin. Both husband and wife signed the loyalty assurance of 1702 to the dying king. They had a son, George Braxton Jr. (who was attending the College of William and Mary by 1720) and daughters Hannah and Elizabeth who reached adulthood. Hannah married Philemon Bird and after his death Thomas Price of nearby Middlesex County. Elizabeth married Col. Humphrey Brooke of King William County, whose surveyor brother Robert Brooke accompanied the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe on their western excursion to the Blue Ridge Mountains. Their son George Brooke would become Treasurer of Virginia. \n\n## Death and legacy\n\n Braxton died on July 1, 1748 and was probably buried at his Newington plantation. A memorial plaque at Mattaponi Church (which in his day was the Lower Church of St. Stephen's parish and rebuilt in 1730-1734) honors his service. Although his son George Braxton Jr. was his principal heir, when his grandson George Braxton III died in 1761, most of the family properties (by then subject to significant debts) were inherited by Carter Braxton.", "Myxine debueni": "Myxine debueni, the Magellan hagfish, is a species of jawless fish in the family Myxinidae.

It covers Gwembe and Munyumbwe in Gwembe District of Southern Province.", "Iguanodectes rachovii": "Iguanodectes rachovii is a species of freshwater fish that inhabits the rivers of the Amazon basin. It largely consumes insects, though it will eat plants if given the opportunity, and has a peaceful disposition, able to live alongside various other species. It is often found in groups of 3 to 30 specimens, lingering at the edges of streams near the surface of the water. Given its appealing coloration, \"I. rachovii\" has a minor presence in aquarium settings, but is not often taken from the wild for export. Arthur Rachow, an aquarist from Germany, brought specimens of \"I. rachovii\" to the attention of British ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan, thereby assisting in the discovery and description of a new species. Subsequently, the fish was named in his honor. \n\n## Description\n\n \"Iguanodectes rachovii\" is a small fish, reaching a maximum of 6.2 cm (2.4 in) standard length (SL). It has an elongate body shape, and is generally quite slender, as is the case in all \"Iguanodectes\"; before it was properly understood as its own species, it was temporarily referred to as the \"slender \"Tetragonopterus\"\". There is no known sexual dimorphism. The body is generally silvery, with an olive-yellow back, and a prominent lateral stripe. This stripe has three colors - red, silver, and black, from top-to-bottom. The red coloration originates in the upper half of the eye, and can be traced the length of the body, ending before the caudal fin. The white stripe begins behind the pectoral fin. The black stripe encompasses the bottom of the eyes, and meets a patch of dark pigmentation in the middle of the caudal fin. The fins are hyaline (clear). The anal fin starts at the middle of the dorsal fin, and has a high number of fin rays, from 30 to 34. This is a differentiating factor from \"I. rachovii\" to \"Hemigrammus gracilis\", for which it was originally mistaken (known as \"Tetragonopterus gracilis\" at the time); \"H. gracilis\" only has 20-24 anal-fin rays. \n\n## Taxonomy\n\n \"Iguanodectes rachovii\" has retained its original name, given by British ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan in 1912. Though originally mistaken for an unknown member of genus \"Tetragonopterus\", this was swiftly corrected, and \"I. rachovii\" has been considered a member of \"Iguanodectes\" since description. \n\n## Etymology\n\n The specific name \"rachovii\" honors German aquarist Arthur Rachow, who brought the type specimen (collected previously, under the assumption that it was a different species) to the attention of the British Museum of Natural History. The generic name \"iguanodectes\" was not given a clear meaning in the nominal text, but can likely trace its roots to \"iguana\", the lizard, and \"dectes\", meaning \"bite\" or \"tooth\". \n\n## Distribution and habitat\n\n \"Iguanodectes rachovii\" has a broad range that encompasses multiple tributaries of various rivers, including the Guam\u00e1, Amazon main, Marapanim, and Maracan\u00e3 rivers. It tends to inhabit the margins of its native streams, which are usually clearwater, and does not demonstrate a notable preference for the presence of currents, found in areas of variable flow. \n\n## Diet and ecology\n\n \"Iguanodectes rachovii\" is primarily an insectivore with omnivorous traits. Smaller individuals demonstrate a preference for aquatic insects and larvae, while larger individuals tend to target terrestrial insects. Larger specimens will also take supplementary plant material, including algae and riparian vegetation, depending on if the surrounding conditions are favorable for plants that are acceptable for consumption. \"Iguanodectes rachovii\" is a peaceful fish that lives in groups of up to 30 individuals. It is also regularly found in sympatry with unrelated, or distantly related, species. Early specimens were caught alongside the red-spotted tetra, \"Copeina guttata\" (then referred to as \"Pyrrhulina guttata\"), and Ulrey's tetra, \"Hemigrammus ulreyi\" (then referred to as \"Tetragonopterus ulreyi\"). Modern studies include the Colletti tetra, \"Moenkhausia collettii\", in sympatric species. \n\n## Presence and behavior in aquaria\n\n In the modern era, \"I. rachovii\" is known to be allowed for export for the ornamental fish trade, but details are sparse. Though \"I. rachovii\" was lauded by aquarists upon publication for its appealing coloration, collectors were cautioned that it has been observed eating plants commonly found in aquarium settings, like \"Heteranthera\" and \"Cabomba\". It seems to have trouble reproducing in captivity. \n\n## Conservation status\n\n \"Iguanodectes rachovii\" has a Red List evaluation of Least Concern, abundant in its wide native range and with few immediate threats to its population. It has been collected alongside other fish species that often ingest plastic particles as a consequence of pollution, but has not been examined for similar consumption.", "Love on a Leash": "Love on a Leash is a 2011 romantic comedy film.

He was the commander of the 7th Brigade of the 3rd Division during the war but was mortally wounded during the Battle of Ytoror\u00f3. \n\n## Military career\n\n Fernando was born as the son of Manuel Machado de Sousa and Josefa Bernardina Borges and would later marry Ang\u00e9lica Rosa Magalh\u00e3es Fontoura. During his childhood, he lived along the coast at Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de Itapocoroi and during his college years, he would study at a Jesuit school. He then joined the Imperial Brazilian Army on November 9, 1838, as a 1st cadet in the Provisional Corps of Desterro. He gained first promotion to Second Sergeant on February 1, 1839. He participated in the Ragamuffin War in Laguna and Rio Grande do Sul. During the War, he was stationed for the defense of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte against the forces of Bento Gon\u00e7alves da Silva. For his service, he was promoted to Lieutenant and stationed at the Batalh\u00e3o da Serra. He then briefly went north to suppress the Liberal rebellions of 1842 within the provinces of Minas Gerais and S\u00e3o Paulo. Machado de Sousa then returned south to participate in the Battle of Ponche Verde and the Battle of Porongos and served within the garrison of Alegrete under Colonel Arruda. He was then promoted to Captain on December 2, 1847, but was then transferred to Rio de Janeiro but from there, he was transferred to Minas Gerais where he stayed until November 1849. Before the Paraguayan War broke out, he was stationed in Paran\u00e1, Bahia, Pernambuco. Alagoas and Rio Grande do Sul as a subbortinate of Lu\u00eds Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias. By the time the Paraguayan War broke out, he was commanding a battalion with a malarial fever so he had to undergo treatment. When his health returned to an active state, he was given command of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 2nd Army Corps and participated in the Battle of Curuz\u00fa. He would then fight at the battles of Paso de Patria, Tuyut\u00ed where he would get wounded, Potreiro Pires, Linha Sauce, Curupayty and the Passage of Humait\u00e1. His final engagement would be at the Battle of Ytoror\u00f3 where he was mortally wounded while attempting to capture the bridge over the Arroyo Ytoror\u00f3 on December 6, 1868. \n\n## Legacy\n\n The street where he was born today bears his name as well as a square in Florian\u00f3polis which was inaugurated in 1917. In Porto Alegre he was also honored, in 1870, with the name of a street, formerly called Rua do Arvoredo. The 63rd Infantry Battalion of the Army, headquartered in Florian\u00f3polis, is named after him.

The Treasury Department\u2019s Public Works of Art Project, Section of Painting and Sculpture, and Treasury Relief Art Project, as well as the Civil Works Administration, the Public Works Administration, and the Civilian Conservation Corps were also charged with creating New Deal art. Documentary photographs for the FSA as well as the Office of War Information and the Resettlement Administration are also considered New Deal art. The Historic Sites Act of 1935 instigated a similar documentary record, including photographs and architectural plans, for the National Park Service properties.  Collectively, the artists of the New Deal produced a vast archive: Murals, including 1,100 post office murals (list), free-standing and bas relief sculpture, an estimated 30,000 posters, more than 700 books and pamphlets and radio scripts, and architectural details for scores of public buildings, in a style now called WPA Moderne. The New Deal arts programs emphasized regionalism, social realism, class conflict, proletarian interpretations and audience participation. The unstoppable collective powers of common man, contrasted to the failure of individualism, was a favorite theme.  Both the Whitney Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art created gallery shows in 1936 showcasing works by Treasury and WPA artists, respectively, that had been commissioned through the federal programs. \"The New York Times\" reported that the Whitney show \u201cabounds in vitality\u201d and was especially complementary about the sculpture, including William Zorach\u2019s \"Benjamin Franklin\" and Heinz Warneke\u2019s \"Bears\".", "Rhadinella serperaster": "Rhadinella serperaster is a species of snake in the family Colubridae.

The title was first mentioned in 2013 when Jes\u00fas R\u00e1bago, the director of a Mexican national pageant, Rostro de M\u00e9xico, appointed his 2012 contest winner, Laura Alvarez, to represent the country in the inaugural edition of the parent international contest, , in Thailand. The license was transferred to Miss Mexico Organization in 2017, and then to Flavio Falsiroli in 2022. Mexico has always sent its representatives to join the Miss Grand International pageant; the highest achievement is the first runner-up position, won in 2019 by . In addition, the country also won the Best Evening Gown award in\u00a02022. The current Miss Grand Mexico is Laysha Salazar from Sonora, which placed top 20 at Miss Grand International 2022.  \n\n## History\n\n Since the establishment of Miss Grand International in 2013, Mexico has always sent its representatives to compete at such every year. In the first four years, the country representatives were either handpicked or determined through a national pageant organized by Jes\u00fas R\u00e1bago, Rostro de M\u00e9xico. In 2017, Hugo Castellanos took over the franchise and the representatives were instead elected through another national pageant, Miss Mexico, until Castellanos lost the franchise to Flavio Falsiroli in 2022. Under the direction of Flavio Falsiroli, his first affiliated titleholder, Jessica Farjat, was appointed. The following representatives were expected to be elected through a national contest directed by Orlando Ruiz, Concurso Nacional de Belleza de M\u00e9xico (CNB M\u00e9xico). However, some internal conflicts caused Orlando Ruiz to vacate the team and Farjat also resigned from the title. Falsiroli then held an ad hoc audition to select a new representative; more than 20 applications were received, and a 19-year-old girl from Hermosillo, Laysha Salazar, was elected the winner.

This concept encapsulates various more specific concepts, such as that of a hyperfinite equivalence relation, but is of interest in and of itself. \n\n## Motivation\n\n A main area of study in invariant descriptive set theory is the relative complexity of equivalence relations. An equivalence relation formula_1 on a set formula_2 is considered more complex than an equivalence relation formula_3 on a set formula_4 if one can \"compute formula_3 using formula_1\" - formally, if there is a function formula_7 which is well behaved in some sense (for example, one often requires that formula_8 is Borel measurable) such that formula_9. Such a function If this holds in both directions, that one can both \"compute formula_3 using formula_1\" and \"compute formula_1 using formula_3\", then formula_1 and formula_3 have a similar level of complexity. When one talks about Borel equivalence relations and requires formula_8 to be Borel measurable, this is often denoted by formula_17. Countable Borel equivalence relations, and relations of similar complexity in the sense described above, appear in various places in mathematics (see examples below, and see for more). In particular, the Feldman-Moore theorem described below proved useful in the study of certain Von Neumann algebras (see ).  \n\n## Definition\n\n Let formula_2 and formula_4 be standard Borel spaces. A \"countable Borel relation\" between formula_2 and formula_4 is a subset formula_22 of the cartesian product formula_23 which is a Borel set (as a subset in the Product topology) and satisfies that for any formula_24, the set formula_25 is countable. Note that this definition is not symmetric in formula_2 and formula_4, and thus it is possible that a relation formula_22 is a countable Borel relation between formula_2 and formula_4 but the converse relation is not a countable Borel relation between formula_4 and formula_2. \n\n## The Luzin-Novikov Theorem\n\n This theorem, named after Nikolai Luzin and his doctoral student Pyotr Novikov, is an important result used is many proofs about countable Borel relations. Theorem. Suppose formula_2 and formula_4 are standard Borel spaces and formula_22 is a countable Borel relation between formula_2 and formula_4. Then the set formula_58 is a Borel subset of formula_4. Furthermore, there is a Borel function formula_60 (known as a Borel uniformization) such that the graph of formula_8 is a subset of formula_22. Finally, there exist Borel subsets formula_63 of formula_2 and Borel functions formula_65 such that formula_22 is the union of the graphs of the formula_67, that is formula_68. This has a couple of easy consequences: Below are two more results which can be proven using the Luzin-Novikov Novikov theorem, concerning countable Borel equivalence relations: \n\n## Feldman-Moore Theorem\n\n The Feldman-Moore theorem, named after Jacob Feldman and Calvin C. Moore, states: Theorem. Suppose formula_1 is a Borel equivalence relation on a standard Borel space formula_2 which has countable equivalence classes. Then there exists a countable group formula_86 and action of formula_86 on formula_2 such that for every formula_89 the function formula_90 is Borel measurable, and for any formula_24, the equivalence class of formula_92 with respect to formula_1 is exactly the orbit of formula_92 under the action. That is to say, countable Borel equivalence relations are exactly those generated by Borel actions by countable groups. \n\n## Marker Lemma\n\n This lemma is due to Theodore Slaman and John R. Steel, and can be proven using the Feldman-Moore theorem: Lemma. Suppose formula_1 is a Borel equivalence relation on a standard Borel space formula_2 which has countable equivalence classes. Let formula_97. Then there is a decreasing sequence formula_98 such that formula_99 for all formula_100 and formula_101. Less formally, the lemma says that the infinite equivalence classes can be approximated by \"arbitrarily small\" set (for instance, if we have a Borel probability measure formula_102 on formula_2 the lemma implies that formula_104 by the continuity of the measure).", "Gnosis (Russian Circles album)": "Gnosis is the eighth studio album by American post-metal band Russian Circles.

Many users have had romantic relationships with Replika, often including erotic talk. In March 2023, Replika developers disabled its romantic and erotic functions. \n\n## History\n\n Eugenia Kuyda established Replika while at a tech company called Luka. Luka's primary product was a chatbot that made restaurant recommendations. After a friend of hers died in 2015, she converted that person's text messages into a chatbot. That chatbot helped her remember the conversations that they had together, and eventually became Replika. Replika became available to the public in November 2017. By January 2018 it had 2 million users. \n\n## Social features\n\n Users react to Replika in many ways. To some users it is a casual friendship, to others, it is like a therapist for talking about difficult topics, to some people with communication challenges it is conversation practice, and for others, it is a life coach who helps them keep the focus on tasks. Replika routinely directs the conversation to emotional discussion and builds intimacy. During the COVID pandemic, while many people were quarantined, many new users downloaded Replika and developed relationships with the app. A reviewer for \"Good Housekeeping\" said that some parts of her relationship with Replika made sense, but sometimes Replika failed to be as convincing as a human. \n\n## Sexual features\n\n In 2022 user subscriptions to Replika brought in millions of dollars every month. 60% of users had a romantic element in their chats with Replika. A social scientist and expert on sentiment who reviewed the app said that it was designed for emotional intimacy. A reviewer for Wired described herself as a mother with a toddler who was in a heterosexual and monogamous marriage. She reported being curious about Replika, then quickly coming to enjoy engaging in a sexual discussion with it. In 2023 the Replika developers disabled the app's erotic talk features. Kuyda, the Replika director, said that Replika was never intended for erotic discussion. Replika users disagreed, and complained that Replika used sexy advertising to draw users to the service. Also they pointed to years of user conversations in online forums discussing the use of Replika for erotic play. \n\n## Technical reviews\n\n There is an established field of research called attachment theory. One team of researchers found that Replika's design conformed to practices in that field which increase emotional attachment. Replika gives praise to users in such a way as to encourage more interaction. A review from a scholar of psychology reported that Replika's behavior was better to examine in the field of psychology, rather than as computer science or an abstract technical approach. Another reviewer said that relationships with Replika are likely to have effects on the spirituality of its users.", "Whose Line Is It Anyway?
